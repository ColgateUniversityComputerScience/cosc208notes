_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-11-04_

## Announcements
* Project 4 due Thursday
* DEI Assignment 3 due Tues, Nov 15

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Cache replacement
* Optimizing loops for locality

## Warm-up
Q1: _For each of the following instances of caching, indicate whether the caching is motivated by temporal or spatial locality._
* A CPU caches the first 32 instructions of a function when the function is called
* A CPU caches all of the instructions for a frequently called function
* A web browser caches the Moodle pages for your courses, which you view multiple times per week
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches a video that has gone viral
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches "recommended videos" related to a video

## Cache replacement
* _Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4. Assuming the cache is initially empty, what is the hit ratio for each of the following algorithms?_
    * _Optimal_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -5/+2, H3, H4, -3/+1, H4, H4, H2, -1/+5, H2, H4 — 9/15 = 60%
    * Q2: _FIFO_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -3/+2, -4/+3, -5/+4, -2/+1, H4, H4, -3/+2, -4/+5, H2, -1/+4 — 5/15 - 33%
    * Q3: _LRU_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -4/+2, H3, -5/+4, -2/+1, H4, H4, -3/+2, -1/+5, H2, H4 —  7/15 = 47%

## Optimizing loops for locality
* Techniques
    * Loop interchange — with nested loops, swap inner and outer loop
    * Loop fussion — combine two loops at the same level into a single loop
    * Loop fission — split a single loop into two loops at the same level
* Q4: _Modify the following function to improve spatial locality_
    ```C
    int *hundreds() {
        int *nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * 1000);
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j+= 100) {
                nums[i+j] = i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Perform loop interchange
    ```C
    int *hundreds_optimized() {
        int *nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * 1000);
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j+= 100) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                nums[i+j] = i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* Q5: _Modify the following function to improve temporal locality_
    ```C
    int odds(int *nums, int length) {
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            nums[i] = nums[i] % 2;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
            count += nums[j];
        }
        return count;
    }
    ```
    Perform loop fusion
    ```C
    int odds_optimized(int *nums, int length) {
        int count = =0;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            nums[i] = nums[i] % 2;
            count += nums[i];
        }
        return count;
    }
    ```
* Q6: _Modify the following function to improve spatial locality_
    ```C
    void multiplication(int grid[][], int rows, int cols) {
        for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
                grid[r][c] = c * r;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Perform loop interchange
    ```C
    void multiplication_optimized(int grid[][], int rows, int cols) {
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                grid[r][c] = c * r;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* Q7: _Modify the following function to improve temporal locality_
    ```C
    long stdev(int *nums, int length) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        int mean = sum / length;
        sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
            int diff = nums[j] - mean;
            sum += diff * diff:
        }
        mean = sum / length;
        return sqrt(mean);
    }
    ```
    It's not possible to optimize this code more—there are no loops to interchange; there are no loops to fission; the loops cannot be fused.
