* Q2: _Where are caches used in computer systems?_
    * Operating systems
    * Web browsers
    * Web servers
    * Domain Name System (DNS)
    * Databases
    * Central Processing Units (CPUs)
    * Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
    * Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
    * Solid State Drives (SSDs)

## Instances of caching
* CPU caches
    * _Why do we have caches on the CPU?_ — accessing main memory is ~100x slower than accessing a register
    * Store instructions and data (stack, heap, etc.) from main memory
    * Three levels --- L1, L2, and L3
    * Range in size from a few KB to a few MB
    * Cache line (i.e., cache entry) is typically larger than a word — e.g., 128 bytes
        * _Why?_ — spatial locality
    * What happens when we write to memory?
        * Write through cache — write to the cache and main memory
        * Write back cache — initially write to the cache; write to main memory when the entry is evicted from the cache
        * What are the advantages of each approach?
            * Write through cache ensures consistency between CPU cores
            * Write back cache only incurs the overhead of accessing main memory when absolutely necessary
* Web browser caches
    * _Why do web browsers have caches?_
        * Accessing remote network storage is >50x slower than accessing a solid state drive (SSD)
        * Spatial locality — many aspects of a web page are also used with other pages on the same site: e.g., images, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript (JS)
        * Temporal locality — users often visit the same web page repeatedly: e.g., Google
        * Internet Service Provider (ISP) may limit amount of data downloaded/uploaded per month
    * Store static content (e.g., images, CSS, JS)
    * Web browser caches are read-only
* Domain Name System (DNS) caches
    * DNS is used to translate domain names (e.g., `portal.colgate.edu`) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (e.g., `149.43.134.29`)
    * DNS entries—i.e., mappings from domain names to IP addresses—can be cached by a web browser, an operating system, and a recursive resolver
        * A recursive resolver is a DNS server within a network that receives DNS queries from clients and queries other DNS servers on the client's behalf in order to locate the desired DNS entry
    * Why are DNS entries cached?
        * Contacting a recursive resolver (and other DNS servers) is much slower than access a solid state drive (SSD)
        * Spatial locality — users often visit subdomains of a domain, e.g., `portal.colgate.edu`, `moodle.colgate.edu`, and `cs.colgate.edu` are subdomains of `colgate.edu`
        * Temporal locality — users often visit the same domain repeatedly
        * Mappings from domain names to IP addresses change infrequently —> DNS entries can be cached for hours or days
* Content distribution networks (CDNs)
    * Collection of geographically distributed servers that delivery content (e.g., streaming videos) to users
    * User's computers contact a server that is "nearby"
        * Ideally measured in terms of latency, which is a function of geographic distance, network routes, and network load
        * Analogy: time it takes to drive somewhere is a function of geographic distance, the route you take, and the amount of traffic on the road
    * CDN servers fetch and cache content from origin servers
    * Popular content (e.g., image from the front page of the NY Times) is more likely to already be cached

## Cache replacement
* If a cache is full, then a cache entry must be removed so different data can be placed in the cache
* Cache replacement policy governs which data is removed
* _What should a good cache replacement policy do?_ — maximize the number of cache hits (or minimize the number of cache misses)
    * Evaluation metric: Hit ratio = number of hits / total number of memory accesses
* _How do we determine which cache entry to replace?_
* Optimal replacement policy – replace the entry that will be accessed furthest in the future
    * Impractical because we don’t know data access patterns a priori
* Least Recently Used (LRU)
    * LRU assumes a item that was accessed recently will be accessed again soon – temporal locality
    * Downside: lots of overhead to implement — need to store an ordered list of items and move an item up in the list whenever it’s accessed
    * Where does this go wrong? — when working-set size (i.e., number of repeatedly accessed entries) is (slightly) greater than size of the cache
* First-in First-out (FIFO)
    * Simple to implement
    * Doesn’t consider the importance of a cache entry
* Random
    * Even simpler to implement
    * Doesn’t consider the importance of a cache entry
