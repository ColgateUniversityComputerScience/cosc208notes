## Control structures
Q2: _Write a program that flips a coin: call `random()` to generate a random number, and print `heads` if the number is even and `tails` if the number is odd._
```C











```
Q3: _Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop._
```C







```
Q4: _Write the same program using a while loop._
```C

## Functions
Q5: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._
```C












```

Q6: _Write a function called `flipcase` that takes a letter and returns the letter in the opposite case. If the character is not a letter, then return the character unchanged._
```C












```

## Extra practice
Q7: _Write a program that prints out the powers of 2 from 2 through 2048._
```C












```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

Q8: _Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100, except:_
* _If the number is divisible by 3 then print `Three`_
* _If the number is divisible by 5 then print `Five`_
* _If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print `Both`_

```C




















```

Q9: _Write a program that prints every letter of the alphabet in upper and lower case: `AaBbCcDd...YyZz`_
```C












```

Q10: _Write a function called `floorm` that takes two integers and rounds down the first integer to the closest multiple of the second integer._
