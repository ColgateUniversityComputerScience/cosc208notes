_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-09-22_

## Announcements
* Complete readings and pre-class questions before each class period
* DEI assignment 1 due Thurs @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Using libraries
* Creating libraries
* Stack frames

## Warm-up
* Q1: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._
    ```C
    int isletter(char ch) {
        if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') { // Uppercase letter
            return 1;
        } else if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') { // Lowercase letter
            return 1;
        } else { // Not a letter
            return 0;
        }
    }
    ```

## Using libraries
* The next two questions focus on the biological process of cell division
* Q2: _Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._
    ```C
    int cells(int rounds) {
        int total = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < rounds; i++) {
            total = total * 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```
* Q3: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have at least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._
    ```C
    int rounds(int cells) {
        int total = 1;
        int rounds = 0;
        while (total < cells) {
            total *= 2;
            rounds++;
        }
        return rounds;
    }
    ```
* Could use exponent to compute number of cells and logarithm to compute number of rounds
* Provided by math library — `#include <math.h>`
    * `double pow(double x, double y);`
    * `double log2(double x);`
* Aside: calculations involving decimal points suffer from small rounding errors, but we are going to using the integer ceiling of the result, so the rounding errors won't be a problem
    * `double round(double x);`
    * `double ceil(double x);`
* Revised functions
    ```C
    int cells(int rounds) {
        double total = pow(2, rounds);
        total = round(total);
        return (int)total;
    } 
    int rounds(int cells) {
        double rounds = log2(cells);
        rounds = ceil(rounds);
        return (int)rounds; // Type cast to integer
    }
    ```
* Compilation error — Why?
    ```bash
    $ clang -o cell_division -Wall -Werror cell_division.c
    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cell_division-810d67.o: in function `cells':
    cell_division.c:(.text+0x1c): undefined reference to `pow'
    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cell_division-810d67.o: in function `rounds':
    cell_division.c:(.text+0x5c): undefined reference to `log2'
    clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
    ```
    * Need to tell compiler to "link" to a library
    * Library contains pre-compiled code
    * Recall: header file contains function prototypes, which allows compiler to know what functions are available in the library
* At runtime, executable and referenced libraries are loaded into memory

## Creating libraries
* Create a header file containing function prototypes
    ```C
    #ifndef __CELLS_H__
    #define __CELLS_H_
    int cells(int rounds);
    int rounds(int cells);
    #endif
    ```
* Create a source file containing function implementations—but **no `main` function**!
* Compile the source file to a library
    ```bash
    clang -Wall -Werror -o libcells.so -fPIC -shared cells.c
    ```
* Write a program that uses functions from the library
    ```C
    #include <cells.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        int r = 10;
        int c = cells(param);
        printf("After %d rounds there are %d cells\n", r, c);
    }
    ```
* Tell the compiler to "link" to the library
    ```bash
    clang -Wall -Werror -o demo -lcells -I. -L. demo.c
    ```
* By default, operating system searches a standard set of directories for libraries — specified by the `PATH` environment variable in the shell
    * Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` path to specify additional directories to search — e.g., current directory if you are using a custom library
        ```bash
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./demo
        ```

## Program stack
* Stores data for functions that are currently executing
* Stored in random access memory (RAM)
* Composed of stack frames
    * A stack frame contains the values stored in a functions's local variables and formal parameters
    * The size of the stack frame is determined by the number and type of local variables and formal parameters
    * A stack frame is added to the top of the stack when a function is called
    * A stack frame is removed from the top fo the stack when a function returns
* Example
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int multiply(int z) {
        return z * 5 / 9;
    }
    int subtract(int x, int y) {
        return x - y;
    }
    int convert(int t) {
        int u = subtract(t, 32);
        int v = multiply(u);
        return v;
    }
    int main() {
        int f = 68;
        int c = convert(68);
        printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
    }
    ```
* C is pass-by-value → changes made to a variable inside a function will not be preserved outside of the function
* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int copy(int a, int b) {
        a = b;
        return a;
    }
    int main() {
        int x = 3;
        int y = 7;
        int z = copy(x, y);
        printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
    }
    ```
    ```
    3 7 7
    ```

## Extra practice
* Q5: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_
    ```C
    int squared(int base) {
        return base * base;
    }
    int dbl(int num) {
        printf("%d x 2\n", num);
        return num * 2;   
    }
    int two(int exponent) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
            result = dbl(result);
        }
        return result;
    }
    int main() {
        int n = 3;
        int s = squared(3);
        printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
        int t = two(3);
        printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
    }
    ```
* Q6: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 9, the program's output would be:_
    ```
    \       /
     \     /
      \   /
       \ /
        X
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    /       \
    ```
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    void print_x_helper(int n, int r) {
        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            if (c == r) {
                printf("\\");
            }
            else if (c == n-1-r) {
                printf("/");
            }
            else {
                printf(" " );
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    void print_x(int n) {
        int r = 0;
        while (r < n/2) {
            print_x_helper(n, r);
            r++;
        }
        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            if (c == r) {
                printf("X");
            }
            else {
                printf(" ");
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
        r++;
        while (r < n) {
            print_x_helper(n, r);
            r++;
        }
    }
    ```
