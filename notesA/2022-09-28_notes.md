_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-09-28_

## Announcements
* DEI assignment 2 due tomorrow @ 11pm
* Programming project 2 due Thurs, Oct 6 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Heap memory deallocation
* 2D arrays on the stack
* 2D arrays as 1D arrays
* 2D arrays as arrays-of-arrays
* Command-line arguments

## Warm-up
_Assume you wanted to write a function that creates a copy of a string. What is wrong with each of the following attempts at writing such a function?_
* Q1:
    ```C
    char *copy1(char strA[]) {
        char strB[strlen(strA) + 1];
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return strB;
    }
    ```
    You cannot return a locally-declared array
* Q2:
    ```C
    char copy2(char strA[]) {
        char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(strA) + 1));
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return *strB;
    }
    ```
    Returns the first character in the copy, instead of an array of characters
* Q3:
    ```C
    char *copy3(char strA[]) {
        char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char *));
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return strB;
    }
    ```
    Allocates space for a pointer, not space for the number of characters in strA

## free
* `void free(void *block)`
* When to free? â€” when a value stored on the heap is no longer needed
    * Free memory regions as soon as you are done
    * Do not read/write the memory location after it has been freed!
* Q4: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    free(ptrA);
    free(ptrB);
    ```
    Double free â€” `ptrA` and `ptrB` point to the same heap region
* Q5: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    ptr[0] = 1;
    free(ptr);
    ptr[1] = 2;
    ```
    Access after free â€” heap region is freed, then used again
* Q6: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    ptr++;
    free(ptr);
    ```
    Not pointing to beginning of allocated region when calling free
* Q7: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    ptrA[0] = 0;
    ptrB[1] = 1;
    free(ptrA);
    ptrB[2] = 2;
    ```
    Access after free â€” `ptrA` and `ptrB` point to the same heap region

## 2D arrays on the stack
* Assume we wanted to create an array to represent a calendar:
    ```
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    ```
    * 4 rows = 4 weeks; 7 columns = 7 days in a week
* Q8: _Write a function called `fill_calendar` that creates a 2D array on the stack and populates the array with the appropriate values._
    ```C
    void fill_calendar() {
        int calendar[4][7];
        int day = 1;
        for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
            for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
                calendar[week][dow] = day;
                day++;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    * _Can we use a formula to compute the day based on week and day-of-week (dow)?_
        ```C
        day = week * 7 + dow + 1;
        ```
    * _Can we return the `calendar` array from this function?_ â€“ no, it is stored in the stack and will go away when the function returns

## 2D arrays as linear arrays
* Can also think of a calendar as fully linear, like a number line or time line
    * Q9: _Fill-in the blanks to complete the `fill_calendar_linear` function which creates a fully linear calendar._
        ```C
        void fill_calendar_linear() {
            int calendar[_____]; // 4 * 7
            int day = 1;
            for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
                for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
                    calendar[__________________] = day; // week * 7 + dow
                    day++;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    * 2D array indices "map to" 1D array indices
        ```
         (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  ...  (3,6) (3,7)
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |     |  27 |  28 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        ```
    * _Can we the change code such that the function can safely return `calendar`?_
        ```C
        int *fill_calendar_linear_heap() {
            int *calendar = malloc(sizeof(int) * 28);
            ...
            return calendar;
        }
        ```
    * Only need a single call to malloc ðŸ˜€
    * Determining indices is hard ðŸ˜•

## 2D arrays as array-of-arrays
* _An array is a..._ â€“ pointer
* _What does our "outer" array store?_ â€“Â pointers
* _What does each "inner" array store?_ â€“ integers
* Example
    ```C
    int **fill_calendar_arrayofarrays_heap() {
        int **calendar = malloc(sizeof(int *) * 4);
        int day = 1;
        for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
            calendar[week] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 7);
            for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
                calendar[week][dow] = day;
                day++;
            }
        }
        return calendar;
    }
    ```
* Memory diagram

## Command-line arguments
* _How are strings represented in C?_Â â€” array of characters, ending with a null character
* An array of strings is an array of arrays
* _What does our "outer" array store?_ â€“ pointers, because arrays (of characters) are pointers
* _What do our "inner" arrays store?_ â€“ characters, because strings are arrays of characters
* Arguments entered on the command line separated by spaces are passed to `main`
    ```bash
    ./myprog abc 123
    ```
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
        }
    }
    ```
    * _Why is `argv` an array of character pointers?_ â€“ we want an array of strings; strings are arrays and arrays and pointers
    * _Why do we need `argc`?_
        * We only include a null character at the end of a string (i.e., an array of characters); we don't include a null character at the end of other types of arrays (e.g., arrays of pointers)
        * Arrays are pointers, which contain the memory address of the first element of the array
        * Length of array is not encoded in array variable, nor is there a special ending indicator --> we need to know how many pointers are in the array, so we don't go beyond the end of the array
