# Architecture: von Neumann
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-03-04_

## Announcements
* 2nd DEI in CS activity due Thursday at 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* von Neumann Architecture
* Hardware building blocks

## Warm-up
* Assume you are given the following code:
    ```C
    struct account {
        int number; // Account number
        int balance; // Current account balance
    };
    struct account *open_account(int starting);
    int close_account(struct account *acct);
    ```
* Q1: _Write the `open_account` function, which creates a new account with a random account number and the specified `starting` balance._
    ```C
    struct account *open_account(int starting) {
        struct account *new = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
        new->number = rand();
        new->balance = starting;
        return new;
    }
    ```
* Q2: _Write the `close_account` function, which eliminates the account `acct` and returns the remaining balance._
    ```C
    int close_account(struct account *acct) {
        int remain = acct->balance;
        free(acct);
        return remain;
    }
    ```

## von Neumann Architecture

* _Where are instructions stored prior to execution?_ — memory unit
* _Where are instructions stored during execution?_ — instruction register
* _Where is data stored when it is not in use?_ — memory unit
* _Where is data stored when it is being operated on?_ — (general purpose) registers
* Notice: instructions and data are both stored in the memory unit, but there are different registers for instructions and data in the CPU
* Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store cycle
    * _What happens in the fetch stage?_ — The control unit loads the next instruction from memory, based on the program counter, into the instruction register
    * _What happens in the decode stage?_ — break instruction into operation and operands; load operands from memory into registers, if necessary
    * _What happens in the execute stage?_ — The ALU performs the operation on the operands
    * _What happens in the store stage?_ — The control unit stores the result in memory
* _How can we make this cycle faster?_
    * Pipelining
    * Parallelism
    * Faster bus
    * Faster ALU/control unit
    * Faster memory
    * Use separate memory units for storing instructions and data and separate buses for loading/storing instructions and data; known as the Harvard Architecture, which addresses the von Neumann bottleneck

## Hardware building blocks
* Transistors — switches that control electrical flow; output state depends on current state plus input state
* Logic gates — created from transistors; implement boolean operations (AND, NO, NOT, etc.)
* Circuit — created from logic gates
* Processing, control, and units — created from circuits
