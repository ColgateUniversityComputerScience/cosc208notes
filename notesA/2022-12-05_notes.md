## SETs

## Virtual machines (VMs)
* Recall: _what is the purpose of an OS?_
    * Make computer hardware easy to use—e.g., an OS knows how to load an application's executable code from persistent storage (e.g., solid state drive (SSD)) into main memory, initialize the process's memory (code, heap, stack), and make the CPU execute the application's instructions
    * Support multiprocessing—i.e., running multiple applications simultaneously or concurrently
    * Allocate and manage hardware resources—e.g., decide when/which applications can use the CPU, decide when/which memory applications can use, prevent applications from stealing/accessing another application's CPU time or memory
* What is the purpose of a virtual machine?
    * Make computer hardware flexible to use
    * Support multiple OSes running concurrently
    * Allocate and manage hardware resources—e.g., decide when/which VMs can use the CPU, decide/when which memory VMs can use, prevent VMS from stealing/accessing another VM's CPU time or memory
* What is the motivation for using a virtual machine?
    * Run multiple OSes concurrently — _why would someone one to do this?_
        * Run software only supported by a specific OS
        * Software testing
        * Server consolidation
        * Security sandboxing
    * Flexibly use hardware resources

## Hypervisors
* _What additional software layer does a computer system need to support virtual machines?_ — hypervisor
* _Where does a hypervisor reside?_
    * Type 1: on top of hardware — e.g., KVM, Xen, Hyper-V, VMware vSphere
    * Type 2: on top of host OS — e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation/Fusion
* _Why is a type 1 hypervisor better than a type 2 hypervisor?_
    * Resources can be oversubscribed
    * No overhead from host OS
* _Why is a type 2 hypervisor better than a type 1 hypervisor?_
    * Easy to use
