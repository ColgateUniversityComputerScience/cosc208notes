## Announcements

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Bitwise operators
* Real numbers

## Warm-up 
_Perform the following computations with 8-bit signed integers_
* Q1: `0b10100011 + 7 = 0b10100011 + 0b00000111 = 0b10101010 = -86`
* Q2: `48 - 0b01100001 = 0b00110000 + 0b10011111 = 0b11001111 = -49`
* Q3: `0b00100000 + 0b01100000 = 0b10000000 = -128` (overflow occurred)

## Bitwise operators
* Apply an operation to a single bit (not) or a pair of bits (and, or, xor)
* `~` (not)
    * Flips bits: if bit is 0, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `~0b101` = `0b010`
* `&` (and)
    * If both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 & 0b0011` = `0b0001`
    * This is different than logical and (`&&`) which checks whether both operands are non-zero
* `|` (or)
    * If either or both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 | 0b0011` = `0b0111`
    * This is different than logical or (`||`) which checks whether at least one operand is non-zero
* `^` (xor)
    * If either, but not both, bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 ^ 0b0011` = `0b0110`
* `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift)
    * Move bits to the left or the right and append or prepend zeros to keep the same number of bits
    * Example: `0b1111 << 0b0010` = `0b1100`
    * Example: `0b1111 >> 0b0001` = `0b0111`
    * Can use bit shifting to multiply or divide by powers of two
* Practice
    * Q4: `0b1010 | 0b0101` = `0b1111`
    * Q5: `0b1010 & 0b0101` = `0b0000`
    * Q6: `~(0b1100 & 0b0110)` = `~0b0100` = `0b1011`
    * Q7: `0b1000 >> 0b011` = `0b0001` (divide by 2^3)
    * Q8: `0b0001 << 0b0010` = `0b0100` (multiply by 2^2)
    * Q9: `0b1111 & (~0b0010)` = `0b1111 & 0b1101` = `0b1101` (clear a bit)
    * Q10: `0b0000 | 0b0010` = `0b0010` (set a bit)

## Real numbers
* Real numbers may have fractional parts -- e.g., `3.14`
* _How can we encode real numbers?_
* Fixed-point representation
    * Location of decimal point is fixed — some bits encode whole numbers, and some bits encode fractional numbers
    * Example: 8-bit fixed point with 3 bits for the fractional part: `0b01011010` = 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^-1 + 1 * 2^-2 + 0 * 2^-3 = 8 + 2 + 1 + 0.25 = 11.25
    * _What is an advantage of fixed-point representation?_
        * Easy to compute
    * _What is a disadvantage of fixed-point representation?_ 
        * Range of real numbers is fixed — cannot represent large whole numbers or small fractional numbers
* Float-point representation
    * Uses a "scaling factor" to multiply (or divide) fractional part
    * Bits in the significand represent (from left to right) 2^-1, 2^-2, ... 2^-23
    * Bits in the exponent represent an unsigned integer 0 - 255
    * Multiple significand by 2^(exponent - 127) to get final result

## Extra practice
_How many bytes of memory are reserved for each of the following variables?_
* Q11: `int a;` = 4
* Q12: `unsigned int b;` = 4
* Q13: `char c;` = 1
* Q14: `long long d;` = 8
* Q15: `int e[5];` = 20
* Q16: `char f[30];` = 30

_Compute the following powers of two_
* Q17: `2^4` = 16
* Q18: `2^6` = 64
* Q19: `2^8` = 256
* Q20: `2^10` = 1024

Q21: _Write a function called `sign` that takes a number expressed in binary using two's complement and returns `-1` if the number is negative, `0` if the number is zero, or `1` if the number is positive. The binary is stored as a character array that starts with `0b` and contains an arbitrary number of `'0'` and `'1'` characters._
```C
int sign(char binary[]) {
    if (binary[2] == '1') {
        return -1;
    } else {
        for (int i = 3; i < strlen(binary); i++) {
            if (binary[i] == '1') {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
