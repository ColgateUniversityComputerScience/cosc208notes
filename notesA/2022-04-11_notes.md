## Outline
* Warm-up
* Cache replacement (continued)
* OS overview

## Warm-up
Q1: _For each of the following instances of caching, indicate whether the caching is motivated by temporal or spatial locality._
* A CPU caches the first 32 instructions of a function when the function is called — spatial
* A CPU caches all of the instructions for a frequently called function — temporal
* A web browser caches the Moodle pages for your courses, which you view multiple times per week — temporal
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches a video that has gone viral — temporal
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches "recommended videos" related to a popular video — spatial

## Cache replacement (continued)
* Recall: optimal replacement policy — replace the entry that will be accessed furthest in the future
* Recall: Least Recently Used (LRU) — replace entry that was accessed furthest in the past
    * Recall: lots of overhead to implement — need to store an ordered list of items and move an item up in the list whenever it’s accessed
    * Where does this go wrong? — when working-set size (i.e., number of repeatedly accessed entries) is (slightly) greater than size of the cache
* First-in First-out (FIFO)
    * Simple to implement
    * Doesn’t consider the importance of a cache entry
* Random
    * Even simpler to implement
    * Doesn’t consider the importance of a cache entry
* _Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4. Assuming the cache is initially empty, what is the hit ratio for each of the following algorithms?_
    * _Optimal_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -5/+2, H3, H4, -3/+1, H4, H4, H2, -1/+5, H2, H4 — 9/15 = 60%
    * Q2: _FIFO_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -3/+2, -4/+3, -5/+4, -2/+1, H4, H4, -3/+2, -4/+5, H2, -1/+4 — 5/15 - 33%
    * Q3: _LRU_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -4/+2, H3, -5/+4, -2/+1, H4, H4, -3/+2, -1/+5, H2, H4 —  7/15 = 47%
    * Q4: _LFU_ — +3, +4, H4, +5, H3, -5/+2, H3, H4, -2/+1, H4, H4, -1/+2, -2/+5, -5/+2, H4 — 7/15 = 47%

## Operating systems (OS) overview
* Purpose of an OS
    * Make computer hardware easy to use—e.g., an OS knows how to load an application's executable code from persistent storage (e.g., solid state drive (SSD)) into main memory, initialize the process's address space (code, heap, stack), and make the CPU execute the application's instructions
    * Support multiprocessing—i.e., running multiple applications concurrently
        * Concurrently == switch between multiple tasks during a window of time—e.g., alternate between cooking and setting the table
        * Simultaneously == complete two tasks at the same time—e.g., listen to a podcast while cooking
    * Allocate and manage hardware resources—e.g., decide when/which applications can use the CPU, decide when/which memory applications can use, prevent applications from stealing/accessing another application's CPU time or memory
    * Many OSes also provide a user interface (UI)
* How does the OS fulfill its duties?
    * Mechanisms — fundamental approaches for managing/providing access to hardware resources
        * E.g., system calls, process abstraction
    * Policy — specific ways of employing an approach; different policies make different trade-offs (in terms of efficiency, performance, etc.)
        * E.g., process scheduler
