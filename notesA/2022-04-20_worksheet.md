# Multiprocessing: preemptive scheduling
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-04-20_

## Announcements
* 3rd DEI activity due tomorrow at 11pm

## Warm-up
Q1: _Consider the following processes:_

| Process | Arrival time | Duration | 
|---------|--------------|----------|
| A       | 0            | 15       |
| B       | 5            | 15       |
| C       | 10           | 60       |

_Determine the schedule and compute the turnaround time for each process using First In First Out (FIFO) scheduling._
