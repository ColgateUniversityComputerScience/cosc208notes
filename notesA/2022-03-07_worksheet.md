## 1-bit circuits

Q7: _Create a circuit for `A > B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_
```







```

Q8: _Create a circuit for `A >= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_
```







```

Q9: _Your goal is to create a 1-bit circuit to perform addition. The circuit will take 3 input bits (`A`, `B`, and `carry_in`) and produce 2 output bits (`sum` and `carry_out`)._

Q9a: _Complete the truth table for this operation_

| `A` | `B` | `carry_in` | `sum` | `carry_out` |
|-----|-----|------------|-------|-------------|
|  0  |  0  |     0      |       |             |
|  0  |  0  |     1      |       |             |
|  0  |  1  |     0      |       |             |
|  0  |  1  |     1      |       |             |
|  1  |  0  |     0      |       |             |
|  1  |  0  |     1      |       |             |
|  1  |  1  |     0      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  1  |     1      |   1   |      1      |
