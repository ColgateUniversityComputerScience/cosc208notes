## Announcements
* Masks are required in class, lab, and office hours
* Before next class: Read Dive Into Systems 1.3-1.4.0 and answer pre-class questions
* First lab today/tomorrow

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Hello, C
* Types
* Operators
* Output

## Warm-up
* Q1: _What are the main components of a computer system?_
    * Central processing unit (CPU)
    * Random access memory (RAM)
    * Secondary storage devices — e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive
    * Input/output (I/O) ports
    * Operating system (OS)
* _What is the role of each of the components?_
    * CPU — executes assembly instructions
    * RAM — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage — stores program data (code, documents, etc.) persistently
    * I/O ports — receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
    * OS — manages hardware resources
* _Why is it important to learn about computer systems?_
    * To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism

## Hello, C
* Write a C program that prints "Hello, C!"
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, C!\n");
        return EXIT_SUCCESS:
    }
    ```
* _How do you compile the program?_
    ```bash
    $ clang -g -Wall -o hello hello.c
    ```
* _How do you run the program?_
    ```bash
    $ ./hello
    ```

## Primitive types
* Most common types
    * `char` — 1 byte (8-bits); integers -128...127; integers 0...127 correspond to ASCII characters
    * `int` — usually 4 bytes (32-bits); integers -2 billion...2 billion
    * `long `— usually 8 bytes (64-bits); integers -9 quintillion...9 quintillion
* Add `unsigned` in front of these types for a range from 0 to 255, 4 billion, or 18 quintillion, respectively

## Operators
* _How would I increment the number stored in a variable `x` by `1`?_
    * `x = x + 1`
    * `x += 1`
    * `x++`
    * `++x`
* Q2: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 2;
        x = x+5;
        printf("%d ", x);
        x = y*2;
        printf("%d ", x);
        x *= 5;
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", x--);
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", --x);
        printf("%d", x);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```
* Q3: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
            int y = x/2;
            int z = x%2;
            printf("%d %d\n", y, z);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```
* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        char y = 'A';
        y = y + 5;
        printf("%c %d\n", y, y);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```

## Output
* What is the syntax for `printf`?
    * `printf(FORMAT_STRING, VALUES, ...);`
    * `FORMAT_STRING` is a string constant (sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes) that may optionally include format specifiers
    * Format specifiers define how to convert a value to a string
        * `%d` decimal (i.e., base 10) number
        * `%c` character
        * `%x` hexadecimal (i.e., base 16) number
        * `%s` string — more on this next week
    * After the format string, include a value for each format specifier
        * A compile error will occur if the number of format specifiers does not match the number of values
        * A compile warning will occur if the value type does not match the format specifier
* Q5: _Assume the variables `year`, `month` and `day` contain the parts of a date. Use `printf` to output the data (e.g., `2022-1-26`)_
    ```C
    printf("%d-%d-%d\n", year, month, day);
    ```
* Q6: _Assume the variables `length` and `width` contain the dimensions of a sports field/court. Use `printf` to output the dimensions (`94ft x 50ft`)_
    ```C
    printf("%dft x %dft\n", length, width);
    ```
* Q7: _Assume the variables `first` and `last` contain a patient's first and last initial, and the variables `systolic` and `diastolic` contain the patient's blood pressure readings. Use `printf` to output the patient's initials and blood pressure (e.g., `A.G. 115/70`)_
    ```C
    printf("%c.%c. %d/%d\n", first, last, systolic, diastolic);
    ```

## Extra practice
* Q8: _Write a program that computes and displays the number of minutes in a year._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int minutes = 365 * 24 * 60;
        printf("%d minutes\n", minutes);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```
