## Threads
A program contains the following global variables and functions:
```C
void *dbl(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t = *t * 2;
}

void *inc(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t = *t + 1;
}
```
_For each of the following main methods, list **all possible outputs** the program could produce. Assume threads are only preempted if they become blocked waiting for other threads._

Q6:
```C
int main() {
    int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *total = 3;
    pthread_t thrA, thrB;
    pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &dbl, total);
    pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &inc, total);
    pthread_join(thrA, NULL);
    pthread_join(thrB, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", total);
}
```

Q7:
```C
int main() {
    int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *total = 3
    pthread_t thrA, thrB;
    pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &inc, total);
    pthread_join(thrA, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &dbl, total);
    pthread_join(thrB, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", total);
}
```

## Number representation
Q8: _Convert `0b10101010` to an unsigned decimal number_
```



```

Q9: _Convert `0b10101010` to an signed decimal number_
```



```

Q10: _Convert `43` to 8-bit two's complement_
```



```

Q11: _Convert `-43` to 8-bit two's complement_
```



```

Q12: _Compute `0b0011 & 0b0101`_
```



```

Q13: _Compute `0b0011 | 0b0101`_
```



```

Q14: _In a system that represents numbers using 8-bit two's complement will the computation `120 + 16` result in overflow, underflow, or neither?_
```



```

Q15: _In a system that represents numbers using 8-bit two's complement will the computation `-120 + -8` result in overflow, underflow, or neither?_
```



```

## Pointers & dynamic memory allocation
Q16: _Assume the following program is executed._
```C
void magic(char *x, char **y) {
    char *z = *y;
    z[2] = 'a';
    *x = 'k';
    *y = &x[1];
    // STOP HERE
}

int main() {
    char *season = malloc(sizeof(char) * 7);
    strcpy(season, "winter");
    char precip[6] = "snow";
    char *ptr = season + 3;
    magic(precip, &ptr);
}
```

_Draw the contents of the stack and heap when the program reaches the comment `STOP HERE`. If a memory region is freed, cross it out; do not erase it from your diagram._

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## Memory errors
The intended behavior of the program below is to output a string that contains multiple copies of a word (e.g., `"byebye"`). The code below compiles without warnings, but it contains multiple errors.
```C
1   #include <stdlib.h>
2   #include <string.h>
3   #include <stdio.h>
4   char *repeat(char *word, int count) {
5       char *dup = malloc(sizeof(*word) * count + 1);
6       int k = 0;
7       for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
8           for (int j = 0; j <= strlen(word) * count; j++) {
9               dup[k] = word[j];
10              k++;
11          }
12      }
13      free(dup);
14      return dup;
15  }
16  int main() {
17      char *orig = malloc(4);
18      strcpy(orig, "bye");
19      char *result = repeat(orig, 2);
20      printf("%s\n", result);
21  }
```
For each of the following errors produced by valgrind, describe (in 2-3 sentences) **why** the error is occurring and **how** you would modify the code to correct the error.
