# Multiprocessing: processes; fork & wait
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-11-09_

## Announcements
* Project 4 due tomorrow @ 11pm
* DEI Assignment 3 due Tuesday

## Outline
* Process abstraction
* Creating processes
* Waiting for processes

## No warm-up — Happy Wednesday!

## Process abstraction
* Process — running program and its corresponding machine state (code, memory, and register values)
    * Program is static code and static data; process is dynamic instance of code and data
    * Cooking analogy
        * Recipe == program
        * Following a recipe == process
        * Ingredients == program inputs
        * Prepared food == program outputs
        * Cabinets, fridge, etc. == persistent storage
        * Prep area (e.g., counter) == registers & main memory
        * Contents and status of the prep area; current step of recipe == machine state
        * Chef == CPU
    * Can have multiple processes all running different instances of the same program
        * Cooking analogy — chef may be making multiple batches of the same recipe
* OS is responsible for...
    * Creating processes — when a user or another application requests it
    * Scheduling processes — i.e., deciding when/which process should be allowed to use the CPU
    * Switching processes — i.e., saving the machine state of one process and restoring the machine state of another process; called context switching
    * Cleaning-up processes — i.e., releasing any resources they are using when the process is done
    * Interacting with I/O devices (e.g., disks, NICs, graphics card) on behalf of processes
* Q1: _Consider building a Lego kit as an analogy for operating systems' process abstraction. Match each component of the analogy with the corresponding component of a real computer system._
    * Instruction booklet == program
    * Following the assembly instructions == process
    * Lego bricks == program inputs
    * Completed kit == program outputs
    * Cabinet/drawers for storing Legos == persistent storage
    * Building area (e.g., tabletop) == registers and main memory
    * Current step for the instruction booklet == program counter
    * You == CPU

## Creating processes
* `int fork()`
    * Creates an exact copy of the running process, except for the return value from `fork` — return `0` to child (i.e., new) process; return child’s process ID to parent process (i.e., process that called fork)
    * Both child and parent resume execution from place where `fork` was called
* Q2: _What does the following code output?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Before fork\n");
        int pid = fork();
        printf("After fork\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Before fork
    After fork
    After fork
    ```
* Q3: _What does the following code output (assuming the new process has PID 1819)?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Before fork");
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child gets %d\n", pid);
        } else {
            printf("Parent gets %d\n", pid);
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Before fork
    Child gets 0
    Parent gets 1819
    ```
    OR
    ```
    Before fork
    Parent gets 1819
    Child gets 0
    ``` 

## Waiting for processes
* Wait for any child to finish — `int wait(int *status)`
    * Returns PID of the child process that finished
    * `status` parameter is optional
        * if passed a valid integer pointer, `wait` will store the return value of the child process's `main` function at the referenced memory location
        * if return value of child process's main function is not needed, then pass `NULL`
* Wait for a specific process to finish — `int waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options)`
    * Returns PID of the process that finished
    * `pid` is PID if process to wait for — need not be a child process
    * `status` is the same as `wait`
    * `options` is typically `0`, except in special circumstances
* Wait functions do not return until child or specific process, respectively, finishes
* Q4: _What are all possible outputs of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child\n");
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("Parent\n");
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Child
    Parent
    ```
* Q1: _What are all possible outputs of this program (assuming the new process has PID 13346)?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        printf("A %d\n", pid);
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("B\n");
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("C\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    ```
    A 0
    A 13346
    B
    C
    ```
    OR
    ```
    A 13346
    A 0
    B
    C
    ```
    OR
    ```
    A 0
    B
    A 13346
    C
    ```

## Extra practice
* Q6: _What does the following code output?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int value = 100;
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            value -= 50;
        } else {
            value += 50;
        }
        printf("My value is %d\n", value);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    My value is 50
    My value is 150
    ```
    OR
    ```
    My value is 150
    My value is 50
    ```
* Q7: _What does the following code output?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Begin\n");
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child\n");
            return 0;
        } else {
            printf("Parent\n");
        }
        printf("End\n");
    }
    ```
    ```
    Begin
    Child
    Parent
    End 
    ```
    OR
    ```
    Begin
    Parent
    Child
    End 
    ```
    OR
    ```
    Begin
    Parent
    End 
    Child
    ```
* Q8: _How would you modify the above program such that `Child` always prints before `Parent`?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Begin\n");
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child\n");
            return 0;
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("Parent\n");
        }
        printf("End\n");
    }
    ```
