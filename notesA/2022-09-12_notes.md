_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-09-12_

## Announcements
* Programming project 1 due Thurs @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Type conversion
* Binary arithmetic
* Overflow

## Warm-up
* _Express these decimal numbers using 8-bit two's complement:_
    * Q1: -49 = `0b11001111`
    * Q2: -11 = `0b11110101`
* _What is the easy way to negate a number?_
    * Flip all bits and add 1
    * Example: 
        * 11 = `0b00001011`
        * Flip bits: `0b11110100`
        * Add 1: `0b11110101`

## Type conversion
* Format specifiers for printing decimal numbers indicate whether to interpret the number as signed or unsigned – e.g.,
    ```C
    int x = -123456;
    printf("%d %u\n", x, x);
    ```
    ```
    -123456 4294843840
    ```
* Range of numbers each type can accommodate depends on the number of bits of memory reserved for a variable of that type
    * `char` - 8 bits --> 0 to 255 (unsigned) or -128 to 127 (signed)
    * `int` – 32 bits --> 0 to ~4.2 billion (unsigned) or ~-2.1 billion to ~2.1 billion (signed)
    * `long` – 64 bits --> 0 to ~18 quadrillion (unsigned) or ~-9 quadrillion to 9 quadrillion (signed)
* _What happens if you attempt to assign a constant value that is too large to represent using the number of available bits?_ – e.g.,
    ```C
    unsigned char c = 300;
    printf("%u\n", c);
    ```
    * Compiler generates a warning
        ```
        warning: implicit conversion from 'int' to 'unsigned char' changes value from 300 to 44 [-Wconstant-conversion]
            unsigned char c = 300;
                          ~   ^~~
        ```
    * Value is truncated
        ```
        44
        ```
* However, if you assign a variable whose value is too large to represent using the number of available bits, then the value is truncated but **no warning is generated** – e.g.,
    ```C
    unsigned int i = 300;
    unsigned char c = i;
    printf("%u\n", c);
    ```
    ```
    44
    ```
* Takeaway: carefully consider the range of values a variable can accommodate, because C will let you do things that are dangerous

## Binary arithmetic
### Addition
Same as decimal, except you carry a one instead of a ten
Example: 5 + 5
```
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
```
```
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
```
```
      1
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
       0
```
```
     01
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
      10
```
```
    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
     010
```
```
    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
  0b1010
```
Check our work:
```
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10 = 5+5
```
Another example: 5 + -5
```
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
```
```
      1
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
       0
```
```
     11
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
      00
```
```
    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
     000
```
```
    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
    0000
(Carry-out => 1)
```

### Subtraction
Simply add the negation

### _Practice using 8-bit signed integers_
* Q3: 10 + 5 = `0b00001010` + `0b00000101` = `0b00001111`
* Q4:7 + 15 = `0b00000111` + `0b00001111` = `0b00010110`
* Q5: -10 + 5 = (`0b11110101` + `0b1`) + `0b00000101` = `0b11110110` + `0b00000101` = `0b11111011`
* Q6: 10 - 5 = `0b00001010` + (`0b11111010` + `0b1`) = `0b00001010` + `0b11111011` = `0b00000101`
* Q7: 64 + 64 = `0b01000000` + `0b1000000` = `0b10000000`

## Overflow
* _Convert the 8-bit signed integer `0b10000000` to decimal:_ -128
* 64 + 64 = -128!? What!?
* Computation overflowed — i.e., result is too large to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to negative numbers
    * Can only occur when you add two positive numbers
* Computation can also underflow — i.e., result is too small to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to positive numbers
    * E.g., -64 + -65 = `0b11000000` + `0b10111111` = `0b01111111` = 127
    * Can only occur when you add two negative numbers
* Overflow and underflow are impossible when adding a positive number and a negative number
    * Assume you add the largest magnitude positive number and the smallest magnitude negative number (-1); the result will be slightly less magnitude than the positive operand, and thus cannot overflow
    * Assume you add the smallest magnitude positive number (1) and the largest magnitude negative number; the result will be slightly less magnitude than the negative operand, and thus cannot underflow
* _What happens if you overflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to zero, and get a smaller positive integer
* _What happens if you underflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to the maximum value, and get a larger positive integer

### _Practice with overflow_
_For each of the following computations, determine whether the computation overflows, underflows, or neither. Assume we are using 8-bit signed integers._
* Q8: `0b10000000` + `0b01111111` — neither
* Q9: `0b10000001` + `0b01111111` — neither
* Q10: `0b10000000` + `0b10000001` — underflow
* Q11: `0b11000000` + `0b11000000` — neither
* Q12: `0b01111111` + `0b00000001` — overflow

## Extra practice
* Q13: _Convert `512` to unsigned binary._ — `0b1000000000`
* Q14: _Convert `-42` to 8-bit signed binary._ — `0b11010110`
* Q15: _Convert `0xFAB` to unsigned binary._ – `0b111110101011`
* Q16: _Write a function called `valid_hex` that takes a string and returns 1 if it is a valid hexadecimal number; otherwise return 0. A valid hexadecimal number must start with `0x` and only contain the digits `0`-`9` and letters `A`-`F` (in upper or lower case)._
    ```C
    int valid_hex(char str[]) {
        if (str[0] != '0' || str[1] != 'x') {
            return 0;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i < strlen(str); i++) {
            if (!((str[i] >= '0 && str[i] <= '9') 
                || (str[i] >= 'A' && str[i] <= 'F') 
                || (str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'f'))) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
    ```
* Q17: _Write a function called `bits_required` that takes an `unsigned long` decimal (i.e., base 10) number and returns the minimum number of bits required to represent the number._
    ```C
    int bits_required(unsigned long number) {
        int bits = 0;
        while (number > 0) {
            bits++;
            number = number / 2;
        }
        return bits;
    }
    ```
