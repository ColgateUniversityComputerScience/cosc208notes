## Operators
Q2: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
int main() {
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    x = x+5;
    printf("%d ", x);
    x = y*2;
    printf("%d ", x);
    x *= 5;
    printf("%d ", x);
    printf("%d ", x--);
    printf("%d ", x);
    printf("%d ", --x);
    printf("%d", x);
}
```

Q3: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
int main() {
    int x = 5;
        int y = x/2;
        int z = x%2;
        printf("%d %d\n", y, z);
}
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    char y = 'A';
    y = y + 5;
    printf("%c %d\n", y, y);
}
```

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.
