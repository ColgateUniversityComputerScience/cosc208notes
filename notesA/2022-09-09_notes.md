## Warm-up

## Decimal -> Binary Conversion
* Why do we care about converting between binary and decimal?
    * We are used to working with decimal numbers, but computers represent numbers in binary 
    * Computers allocate a fixed number of bits for different types of variables; mathematical operations whose result exceeds the number of available bits will return unexpected results — we'll talk about overflow (and underflow) on Monday
* Repeated division method
    * Check if number is even or odd: even => 0, odd => 1
    * Build binary number from right to left
    * Divide by two, dropping the fractional part: e.g., 5/2 = 2, 1/2 = 0
    * Repeat, until reach 0
* _What is alternative way to convert from decimal to binary?_ — subtract powers of two
* _Convert these decimal numbers to binary:_
    * Q14: `10` = `0b1010`
    * Q15: `15` = `0b1111`
    * Q16: `42` = `0b101010`
    * Q17: `192` = `0b11000000`

## Signed integers
* _How can we distinguish between positive values, zero, and negative values?_
* Use a bit to encode the sign — called signed magnitude
    * _What is an advantage of signed magnitude?_
        * Easy to convert between negative and positive values
    * _What is a disadvantage of signed magnitude?_
        * Positive zero and negative zero
        * Discontinuity between positive and negative values
* Have the highest order bit contribute a negative value to the sum — called two's complement
    * Example unsigned conversion: `0b0101`
        * 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5
    * Example signed conversion: `0b0101`
        * 0 * -2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5
    * Another example signed conversion: `0b1011`
        * 1 * -2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = -8 + 2 + 3 = -5
    * _How many values can be represented using 4 bits?_ — 2^4 = 16
        * One of these values is zero (`0b0000`)
        * _How many positive values an be represented using 4 bits?_ 2^4 / 2 - 1 = 7
        * _How many negative values can be represented using 4 bits?_ 2^4 / 2 = 8
* _Express these decimal numbers using 8-bit two's complement:_
    * Q18: `13` = `0b00001101`
    * Q19: `-128` = `0b10000000`
    * Q20: `-64` = `0b11000000`
    * Q21: `-1` = `0b11111111`
    * Q22: `-13` = `0b11110011`
    * Q23: `127` = `0b01111111`

## Type conversion
* Format specifiers for printing decimal numbers indicated whether to interpret the number as signed or unsigned – e.g.,
    ```C
    int x = -123456;
    printf("%d %u\n", x, x);
    ```
    ```
    -123456 4294843840
    ```
* Range of numbers each type can accommodate depends on the number of bits of memory reserved for a variable of that type
    * `char` - 8 bits --> 0 to 255 (unsigned) or -128 to 127 (signed)
    * `int` – 32 bits --> 0 to ~4.2 billion (unsigned) or ~-2.1 billion to ~2.1 billion (signed)
    * `long` – 64 bits --> 0 to ~18 quadrillion (unsigned) or ~-9 quadrillion to 9 quadrillion (signed)
* _What happens if you attempt to assign a constant value that is too large to represent using the number of available bits?_ – e.g.,
    ```C
    unsigned char c = 300;
    printf("%u\n", c);
    ```
    * Compiler generates a warning
        ```
        warning: implicit conversion from 'int' to 'unsigned char' changes value from 300 to 44 [-Wconstant-conversion]
            unsigned char c = 300;
                          ~   ^~~
        ```
    * Value is truncated
        ```
        44
        ```
* However, if you assign a variable whose value is too large to represent using the number of available bits, then the value is truncated but **no warning is generated** – e.g.,
    ```
    unsigned int i = 300;
    unsigned char c = i;
    printf("%u\n", c);
    ```
    ```
    44
    ```
* _What happens if you attempt to assign a variable that has fewer bits to a variable that has more bits?_ – e.g.,
    ```C
     signed char c = -13; // On ARM, char is unsigned by default
     int i = c;
     printf("%d\n", i);
     ```
     * Value is _sign extended_ – i.e., upper-most bit in existing variable is copied to all additional bits in new variable
        ```
        -13
        ```
    * Sign extension example
        * Assume 4 bits of memory are allocated to represent a number – e.g., `0b1010`
            * _What is the value of this number as a signed decimal number?_ – -6 = 1 * -2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0
        * Assume 8 bits of memory are now available
            * Without sign extension, the extra bits are always set to zero – e.g., `0b00001010`, which is 10 as a signed decimal number (0 * -2^7 + 0 * 2^6 + 0 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0)
            * With sign extension, the extra bits are set to the uppermost bit of the original value – e.g., `0b11111010`, which is -6 as a signed decimal number (1 * -2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0)
* Takeaway: carefully consider the range of values a variable can accommodate, because C will let you do things that are dangerous

## Extra practice
* _Convert these binary numbers to decimal:_
    * Q25: `0b10100` = 20
    * Q26: `0b101000` = 40
* Q31: _Write a function called `check_password` that returns 1 if a password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit. Otherwise, the function returns 0. You may want to use the functions `isupper`, `islower`, and `isdigit`. They take a character as a parameter and return 1 if the character is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit, respectively; otherwise, they return 0._
    ```C
    int check_password(char passwd[]) {
        if (strlen(passwd) < 8) {
            return 0;
        }
        int lower = 0;
        int upper = 0;
        int digit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < strlen(passwd); i++) {
            if (islower(passwd[i])) {
                lower++;
            }
            else if (isupper(passwd[i])) {
                upper++;
            }
            else if (isdigit(passwd[i])) {
                digit++;
            }
        }
        if (lower == 0 || upper == 0 || digit == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
    ```
