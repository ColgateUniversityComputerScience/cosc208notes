## Warm-up
Q1: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
int main() {
    char first[] = "Colgate";
    char second[10] = "Univ";
    printf("%lu %lu\n", strlen(first));
    printf("%lu %lu\n", strlen(second));
    first[strlen(first)] = '-';
    second[strlen(second)-1] = '.';
    printf("%s%s\n", first, second);
    first[3] = '.';
    first[4] = '\0';
    printf("%s %s\n", first, second);
}
```

Q2: _Write a program that asks the user for a string and prints the string backwards._
```C

## Extra practice
Q15: _Write a function called `count_words` that takes a string and counts the number of words in the string. Assume each word is separated by a single space, and the string will contain at least one word. For example, `"Today is Wednesday."` contains 3 words._
