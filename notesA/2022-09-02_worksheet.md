# C: stack frames; using libraries
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-09-02_

## Announcements
* Complete readings and pre-class questions before each class period
* DEI assignment 1 due Thurs @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Using libraries
* Creating libraries
* Stack frames

## Warm-up
Q1: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._
```C














```

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the warm-up; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Using libraries
The next two question focus on the biological process of cell division

Q2: _Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._
```C









```

Q3: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have ta least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._
```C











```

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Program stack example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int multiply(int z) {
    return z * 5 / 9;
}
int subtract(int x, int y) {
    return x - y;
}
int convert(int t) {
    int u = subtract(t, 32);
    int v = multiply(u);
    return v;
}
int main() {
    int f = 68;
    int c = convert(68);
    printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Program stack practice
Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int copy(int a, int b) {
    a = b;
    return a;
}
int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 7;
    int z = copy(x, y);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
}
```

## Extra practice
Q5: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_
```C
int squared(int base) {
    return base * base;
}
int dbl(int num) {
    printf("%d x 2\n", num);
    return num * 2;   
}
int two(int exponent) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
        result = dbl(result);
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    int n = 3;
    int s = squared(3);
    printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
    int t = two(3);
    printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
}
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Q6: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 9, the program's output would be:_

```
\       /
 \     /
  \   /
   \ /
    X
   / \
  /   \
 /     \
/       \
```
