## Logical operations
Q6: _Fill-in the truth tables for the following logical operations_

| A | B | (A != B) | (A > B) | (A >= B) |
| - | - | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 0 | 0 |    0     |    0    |    1     |
| 0 | 1 |    1     |    0    |    0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1     |    1    |    1     |
| 1 | 1 |    0     |    0    |    1     |

## 1-bit circuits

### Steps
* _Design the truth table: e.g., A != B_

| A | B | A != B |
| - | - | ------ |
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |   0    |

* For each row where the output value is 1:
    * Determine how to make each input 1 — e.g., either `A` or `NOT(A)`
    * Conjunct the two subexpressions — e.g., `NOT(A) AND B`
* Create the disjunction of the expressions for each row — e.g., `(NOT(A) AND B) OR (A AND NOT(B))`
* Create a circuit from left to right, starting with the inner-most subexpressions

* _Can we build a circuit that uses fewer gates?_
    * `A XOR B`
    * `(A OR B) AND (NOT (A AND B))`

### Practice
Q7: _Create a circuit for `A > B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

`A AND NOT(B)`

Q8: _Create a circuit for `A >= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

`(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND B)`

* Alternatives
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR (A AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND B)`
    * `(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) OR A`
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR A`
    * `NOT(NOT(A) AND B)`
    * `A OR NOT(B)`

Q9: _Your goal is to create a 1-bit circuit to perform addition. The circuit will take 3 input bits (`A`, `B`, and `carry_in`) and produce 2 output bits (`sum` and `carry_out`)._

Q9a: _Complete the truth table for this operation_

| `A` | `B` | `carry_in` | `sum` | `carry_out` |
|-----|-----|------------|-------|-------------|
|  0  |  0  |     0      |   0   |      0      |
|  0  |  0  |     1      |   1   |      0      |
|  0  |  1  |     0      |   1   |      0      |
|  0  |  1  |     1      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  0  |     0      |   1   |      0      |
|  1  |  0  |     1      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  1  |     0      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  1  |     1      |   1   |      1      |

Q9b: _What is the boolean expression for `sum`?_

```
(NOT(A) AND NOT(B) AND carry_in)
OR (NOT(A) AND B AND NOT(carry_in))
OR (A AND NOT(B) AND NOT(carry_in))
OR (A AND B AND carry_in) 
```

Q9c: _Draw the circuit for `sum`_

Q9d: _What is the boolean expression for `carry_out`?_

```
(NOT(A) AND B AND carry_in)
OR (A AND NOT(B) AND carry_in)
OR (A AND B AND NOT(carry_in))
OR (A AND B AND carry_in)
```

Q9e: _Draw the circuit for `carry_out`_
