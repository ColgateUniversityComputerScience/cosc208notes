# Program memory: malloc
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-09-26_

## Announcements
* DEI assignment 2 due Thurs, Sept 29
* Programming project 1 due Thurs, Oct 6 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Pointers as return values
* Program memory
* Heap memory allocation

## No warm-up — Happy Monday!

## Pointers as return values
* _What happens?_
    ```C
    int *one() {
        int x = 1;
        int *p = &x;
        return p;
    }
    int main() {
        int *q = one();
        printf("%d\n", *q);
    }
    ```  
    * `q` points to a variable that no longer exists!
* _So, how can I return a pointer from a function?_ — dynamically allocate memory on the heap!

## Program memory
* Memory layout

    ```
    * Stack consists of stack frames --- add a frame when a function is called, remove a frame when a function returns
* Variable storage
    * Local variables and parameters and stored on the stack --- in the frame for the function in which they are declared
    * Global variables are stored in the data section
* Memory allocation
    * Code and data — automatically allocated with a program starts
    * Stack — automatically allocated when a function is called; automatically deallocated when a function returns
    * Heap memory — explicitly allocated and freed by a program

## malloc
* `void* malloc(unsigned int size)`
* Memory allocated on the heap persists until explicitly freed
* When to malloc?
    * When the amount of space required is not known until runtime
    * When a value must remain in memory even after returning from a function
* How much to malloc?
    * Use `sizeof` and a type: e.g., `sizeof(int)`
    * How much to malloc for an array? — multiply sizeof(type) by number of elements in array
* Q2: _Write a function called `duplicate` that takes a string (i.e., an array of `char`) as a parameter and returns a copy of that string stored on the heap._
    ```C
    char *duplicate(char orig[]) {
        char *copy = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(orig) + 1));
        for (int i = 0; i <= strlen(orig); i++) {
            copy[i] = orig[i];
        }
        // Could replace for loop with: strcpy(copy, orig);
        return copy;
    }
    ```
* Q3: _Write a function called `range` that behaves similar to the `range` function in Python. Your function should take an unsigned integer (`length`) as a parameter, and return a dynamically allocated array with `length` unsigned integers. The array should be populated with the values 0 through `length-1`._
    ```C
    unsigned int *range(unsigned int length) {
        unsigned int *nums = malloc(sizeof(unsigned int) * length);
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            nums[i] = i;
        }
        return nums;
    }
    ```
* Q4: _Write a function called `generate_password` that takes an unsigned integer (`length`) as a parameter, and returns a dynamically allocated array of with `length` randomly selected characters (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, symbols). Your function should use the `rand()` function from the C standard library, which returns a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to `RAND_MAX`._
    ```C
    char *generate_password(unsigned int length) {
        char *password = malloc(sizeof(char) * (length + 1));
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            password[i] = (rand() % ('~' - '!')) + '!';
        }
        password[length] = '\0';
        return password;
    }
    ```

## Extra practice
* Q5: _Write a function called `lengths` that takes an array of strings and the number of elements in the array and returns an array of integers containing the length of each string._
    ```C
    int *lengths(char *strs[], int count) {
        int *lens = malloc(sizeof(int) * count);
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            lens[i] = strlen(strs[i]);
        }
        return lens;
    }
    ```
