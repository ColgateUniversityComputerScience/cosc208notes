## Warm-up
Q1: _Draw a memory diagram depicting the contents of the stack and heap immediately before the function `elongate("dog")` returns._
```C
char **elongate(char *str) {
    char **result = malloc(sizeof(char *) * strlen(str));
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
        result[i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * (i + 2));
        for (int j = 0; j < i+1; j++) {
            result[i][j] = str[j];
        }
        result[i][i+1] = '\0';
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Command-line arguments
* _How are strings represented in C?_ — array of characters, ending with a null character
* An array of strings is an array of arrays
* _What does our "outer" array store?_ – pointers, because arrays (of characters) are pointers
* _What do our "inner" arrays store?_ – characters, because strings are arrays of characters
* Arguments entered on the command line separated by spaces are passed to `main`
    ```bash
    ./myprog abc 123
    ```
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
        }
    }
    ```
    * _Why is `argv` an array of character pointers?_ – we want an array of strings; strings are arrays and arrays and pointers
    * _Why do we need `argc`?_
        * We only include a null character at the end of a string (i.e., an array of characters); we don't include a null character at the end of other types of arrays (e.g., arrays of pointers)
        * Arrays are pointers, which contain the memory address of the first element of the array
        * Length of array is not encoded in array variable, nor is there a special ending indicator --> we need to know how many pointers are in the array, so we don't go beyond the end of the array

## Structs
* _How is a struct declared?_
    ```C
    struct tvshow {
        char name[100];
        int season;
    };
    ```
* _How are fields of the struct accessed?_ — with the dot (.) operator
    ```C
    struct tvshow favorite;
    strncpy(favorite.name, "This Old House", 100);
    favorite.season = 44;
    ```
* A struct is a collection of values; it is **not** an object, and hence cannot have methods associated with it
* A struct variable holds *values* for the fields of the struct; it is **not** a reference to the struct, and hence a copy of the values are passed to functions
* Q2: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    struct one {
        char x;
        char y;
    };
    struct two {
        int m;
        int n[10];
    };
    int main() {
        struct one a;
        struct two b;
        printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(struct one), sizeof(a.y));
        printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(b), sizeof(b.n));
    }
    ```
    ```
    2 1
    44 40
    ```
* Q3: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    struct alpha {
        char x[10];
        int y;
    };
    struct beta {
        int b;
        int c;
    };
    int main() {
        struct alpha a = { "Colgate", 13 };
        struct beta b = { 1, 2 };
        struct beta c = { 3, 4 };
        a.y += -13;
        b.b = 5;
        c = b;
        b.c = 6;
        printf("a %s %d\n", a.x, a.y);
        printf("b %d %d\n", b.b, b.c);
        printf("c %d %d\n", c.b, c.c);
    }
    ```
    ```
    a Colgate 0
    b 5 6
    c 5 2
    ```

## Pointers to structs
* _How do you get a pointer to a struct?_
    * Use address-of (`&`) operator with a parameter/local variable
        ```C
        struct tvshow {
            char name[100];
            int season;
        };
        ```
        ```C
        int main() {
            struct tvshow favorite = {"This Old House", 44};
            struct tvshow *ptr = &favorite;
        }
        ```
    * Allocate space on the heap
        ```C
        int main() {
            struct tvshow *ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct tvshow));
        }
        ```
* _How do you access a struct's fields through a pointer to the struct?_
    * `(*ptr).field`
        ```C
        printf("There are %d seasons of %s\n", (*ptr).seasons, (*ptr).name);
        ```
        * Don't do `*ptr.field` — it will try to dereference `field` not `ptr`, because `.` has higher precedence than `*`
    * `ptr->field`
        ```C
        printf("There are %d seasons of %s\n", ptr->seasons, ptr->name);
        ```
* Assume you are given the following code:
    ```C
    struct account {
        int number; // Account number
        int balance; // Current account balance
    };
    int deposit(struct account *acct, int amount);
    int transfer(struct account *from, struct amount *to, int amount);
    ```
    * Q4: _Write the `deposit` function, which adds `amount` to the balance of `acct`. The function should return the amount deposited._ – _Postponed to next class_
    * Q5: _Write the `transfer` function which moves `amount` from one account to another. The function should return the amount transferred if the transfer was successful or 0 otherwise._ – _Postponed to next class_

## Extra practice
* Q6: _Write a struct definition to represent a date (year, month number, and day)._
    ```C
    struct date {
        int year;
        int month;
        int day;
    };
    ```
* Q7: _Write a function called `compare` that takes two date structs and returns -1 if the first date occurs before the second, 0 if the dates are equal, and 1 if the first date occurs after the second._
    ```C
    int compare(struct date a, struct date b) {
        if (a.year < b.year) {
            return -1;
        } else if (b.year < a.year) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            if (a.month < b.month) {
                return -1;
            } else if (b.month < a.month) {
                return 1;
            } else { 
                if (a.day < b.day) {
                    return -1;
                } else if (b.day < a.day) {
                    return 1;
                } else {
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* _Two structs have been defined representing a queue and an item on a queue._
    ```C
    struct item {
        int value;
        struct item *next;
    };
    struct queue {
        struct item *head;
        struct item *tail;
    };
    ```
    _The `new_queue` function creates a new, empty queue._
    ```C
    struct queue *new_queue() {
        struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
        q->head = NULL;
        q->tail = NULL;
        return q;
    }
    ```
* Q8: _Write a function called `enqueue` that adds a new value at the end of the queue._
    ```C
    void enqueue(int value, struct queue *q) {
        struct item *i = malloc(sizeof(struct item));
        i->value = value;
        i->next = NULL;
        if (q->tail == NULL) {
            q->head = i;
            q->tail = i;
        } else {
            q->tail->next = i;
            q->tail = i;
        }
    }
    ```
* Q9: _Write a function called `dequeue` that removes and returns the value at the head of the queue. The function should return -1 if the queue is empty._
    ```C
    int dequeue(struct queue *q) {
        if (NULL == q->head) {
            return -1;
        }
        struct item *i = q->head;
        int v = i->value;
        q->head = i->next;
        if (q->head == NULL) {
            q->tail = NULL;
        }
        free(i);
        return v;
    }
    ```
* Q10: _Write a function called `free_queue` that empties and frees a queue._
    ```C
    void free_stack(struct queue *q) {
        while (q->head != NULL) {
            dequeue(q);
        }
        free(q);
    }
    ```
