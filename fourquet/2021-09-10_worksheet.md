_Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal:_

Q29: `0xC`

Q30: `0x18`

Q31: `0x30`

_Write the following functions:_

Q32: _`abbreviate`: takes a string and modifies the string in place to include only the first letter of each word. For example, `"Talk To You Later"` is converted to `TTYL`._

Q33: _`check_password`: takes a string and returns 1 if the string is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one digit. Otherwise, the function returns 0. You may want to use the functions `isupper`, `islower`, and `isdigit`. They take a character as a parameter and return 1 if the character is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit, respectively; otherwise, they return 0._
