## Overflow
_For each of the following computations, determine whether the computation overflows, underflows, or neither. Assume we are using 8-bit signed integers._

Q8: `0b10000000` + `0b01111111`
```



```

Q9: `0b10000001` + `0b01111111`
```



```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

Q10: `0b10000000` + `0b10000001`
```



```

Q11: `0b11000000` + `0b11000000`
```



```

Q12: `0b01111111` + `0b00000001`
```



```

## Extra practice

Q16: _Write a function called `valid_hex` that takes a string and returns 1 if it is a valid hexadecimal number; otherwise return 0. A valid hexadecimal number must start with `0x` and only contain the digits `0`-`9` and letters `A`-`F` (in upper or lower case)._
