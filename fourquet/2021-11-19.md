# Mem & OS Review
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2021-11-19_

## Announcements

* Project 3 due Thursday, December 2

## Outline
* Memory hierarchy
* Caching
* Processes
* Scheduling
* Threads

## Memory hierarchy
* Q1: What is the **fastest volatile** memory? — registers
* Q2: What is the **fastest non-volatile** memory? — solid state drive (SSD)
* Q3: Why is a hard disk drive (HDD) slower than a solid state drive (SSD)? — an HDD has moving parts that need to be moved into position before data can be read/written
* Q4: Why is accessing main memory (i.e., Random Access Memory (RAM)) slower than accessing a cache? — a cache is part of the CPU, but data needs to travel across a bus to move between the CPU and main memory
* Q5: Why do solid state drives (SSDs) cost less per unit of capacity than main memory (i.e., Random Access Memory (RAM))? — SSDs have slower access latency

## Caching
* Q6: _Assume the cache size is 3 and the **optimal** cache replacement algorithm is used. Indicate what happens with the cache on each data access._
    * Access 2 — +2
    * Access 4 — +4
    * Access 1 — +1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 3 — -1/+3
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — -3/+1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — Hit
* Q7: _Assume the cache size is 3 and the **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used. Indicate what happens with the cache on each data access._
    * Access 2 — +2
    * Access 4 — +4
    * Access 1 — +1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 3 — -1/+3
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — -3/+1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — Hit

## Processes
* Q8: _Write a program that creates a new process. The child process should print "I am a child"; the parent process should print "I am a parent; my child is CPID" (replacing CPID with the child’s PID)._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("I am a child\n");
        }
        else {
            printf("I am a parent; my child is %d\n", pid);
        }
    }
    ```
* Q9: _Will the output produced by your program always appear in a particular order? Why or why not?_
    * No, because the parent does not `wait` for the child to finish before printing, and the OS scheduler determines which order the processes run
    * If you included a call to `wait` before the call to `printf` in the else body, then the answer would be yes, because the parent waits for the child to finish before printing

## Scheduling
_Consider the following set of processes:_

| Process | Duration | Arrival Time |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| A       | 20       | 0            |
| B       | 15       | 0            |
| C       | 25       | 5            |
| D       | 5        | 10           |

```
  A                   B              C                        D

## Threads
_A program contains the following functions:_
```C
void *dec(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t--;
}

void *inc(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t++;
}

void *zero(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t = 0;
}
```
_For each of the following main methods, list **all possible outputs** the program could produce. Assume threads are only preempted if they become blocked waiting for other threads._
* Q18:
    ```C
    int main() {
        int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *total = 2;
        pthread_t thrA, thrB;
        pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &inc, total);
        pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &inc, total);
        pthread_join(&thrA);
        pthread_join(&thrB);
        printf("%d\n", *total);
    }
    ```
    * `4`
* Q19:
    ```C
    int main() {
        int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *total = 2;
        pthread_t thrA, thrB;
        pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &dec, total);
        pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &zero, total);
        pthread_join(&thrA);
        pthread_join(&thrB);
        printf("%d\n", *total);
    } 
    ```
    Possible outputs:
    * `0`
    * `-1`

    
* Q20:
    ```C
    int main() {
        int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *total = 2;
        pthread_t thrA, thrB;
        pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &zero, total);
        pthread_join(&thrA);
        pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &inc, total);
        pthread_join(&thrB);
        printf("%d\n", *total);
    } 
    ```
    Possible outputs:
    * `1`
