## Review: memory
* The intended behavior of the program below is to output a string that contains multiple copies of a word (e.g., `"byebye"`). The code below compiles without warnings, but it contains multiple errors.
    ```C
    1   #include <stdlib.h>
    2   #include <string.h>
    3   #include <stdio.h>
    4   char *repeat(char *word, int count) {
    5       char *dup = malloc(sizeof(*word) * count + 1);
    6       int k = 0;
    7       for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    8           for (int j = 0; j <= strlen(word) * count; j++) {
    9               dup[k] = word[j];
    10              k++;
    11          }
    12      }
    13      free(dup);
    14      return dup;
    15  }
    16  int main() {
    17      char *orig = malloc(4);
    18      strcpy(orig, "bye");
    19      char *result = repeat(orig, 2);
    20      printf("%s\n", result);
    21  }
    ```
    For each of the following errors produced by valgrind, describe (in 2-3 sentences) **why** the error is occurring and **how** you would modify the code to correct the error.

    * Q1:
        ```
        Invalid write of size 1
            at 0x4006CA: repeat (repeat.c:9)
            by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
        Address 0x5204093 is 0 bytes after a block of size 3 alloc'd
            at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
            by 0x40066B: repeat (repeat.c:5)
            by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
        ```
        Not enough space was allocated for the duplicated string: `sizeof(*word)` gets the size of a single character. Use `strlen(word)` to get the number of characters in the original word.
    * Q2:
        ```
        Invalid read of size 1
            at 0x4006BF: repeat (repeat.c:9)
            by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
        Address 0x5204044 is 0 bytes after a block of size 4 alloc'd
            at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
            by 0x400723: main (repeat.c:17)
        ```
        The inner for loop goes beyond the end of the original word. The for loop condition should be `j < strlen(word)`.
    * Q3:
        ```
        Invalid read of size 1
            at 0x4E88CD0: vfprintf (vfprintf.c:1632)
            by 0x4E8F8A8: printf (printf.c:33)
            by 0x40076B: main (repeat.c:20)
        Address 0x5204090 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 3 free'd
            at 0x4C2EDEB: free (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
            by 0x4006FF: repeat (repeat.c:13)
            by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
        Block was alloc'd at
            at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
            by 0x40066B: repeat (repeat.c:5)
            by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
        ```
        The string containing the repeated word is free'd (in `repeat`) before it is printed (in `main`). Move the call to `free` in `repeat` to after the call to `printf` in `main`.
    * Q4:
        ```
        4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
            at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
            by 0x400723: main (repeat.c:17)
        ```
        The space for the original word (allocated in `main`) is not freed. Add `free(orig)` after the call to `repeat` in `main`.

## Review: threads
* A program contains the following global variables and functions:
    ```C
    void *dbl(void *arg) {
        int *t = (int *)arg;
        *t = *t * 2;
    }

    void *one(void *arg) {
        int *t = (int *)arg;
        *t = 1;
    }
    ```
    _For each of the following main methods, list **all possible outputs** the program could produce. Assume threads are only preempted if they become blocked waiting for other threads._
    * Q5:
        ```C
        int main() {
            int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
            *total = 3;
            pthread_t thrA, thrB;
            pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &dbl, total);
            pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &one, total);
            pthread_join(&thrA);
            pthread_join(&thrB);
            printf("%d\n", total);
        }
        ```
        * `1` (if `thrB` runs after `thrA` finishes)
        * `2` (if `thrA` runs after `thrB` finishes)
    * Q6:
        ```C
        int main() {
            int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
            *total = 3
            pthread_t thrA, thrB;
            pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &one, total);
            pthread_join(&thrA);
            pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &dbl, total);
            pthread_join(&thrB);
            printf("%d\n", total);
        }
        ```
        * `2` (`thrA` is joined, i.e., must finish, before `thrB` is created) 

## Review: sockets
* Q7: _What sequence of socket functions should a server application call?_
    1. `socket`
    2. `bind`
    3. `listen`
    4. `accept`
    5. `recv`
    6. `send`
    7. `close`
    8. `close`
