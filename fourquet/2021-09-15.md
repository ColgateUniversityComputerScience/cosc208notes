## No warm-up — happy Wednesday!

## Binary arithmetic
_Perform the following calculations. Operands are be encoded using two's complement encoding with 6 bits. For each calculation, express the result in binary and decimal, and indicate whether the result overflows, underflows, or neither._
* `0b110000 + 0b111111 = 0b101111 = -17`; neither
* `0b001111 + 0b000001 = 0b010000 = 16`; neither
* `0b101010 + 0b100100 = 0b001110 = 14`; underflow
* `0b001000 + 0b011000 = 0b100000 = -32`; overflow
* `0b110000 + 0b010000 = 0b000000 = 0`; neither


## Strings
* _The following program should ask the user to enter a word, then print the word's length and whether it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). For example, if the user enters `"kayak"` the program should print `"The word is 5 characters long and is a palindrome."` However, the program contains several errors. Modify the program to correct the errors._
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>

    void palindrome(char word[]) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = strlen(word);
        while (i < j) {
            if (word[i] != word[j]) {
                return -1;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return 1;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("Enter a word: ");
        char word[50];
        fgets(word, 50, stdin);
        word[strlen(word)-1] = '\0'; // Remove newline
        int len = strlen(word);
        printf("The word is %c characters long and is ", len);
        if (palindrome(word)) {
            printf("a palindrome.\n");
        } else {
            printf("not a palindrome.\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    * `#include <string.h>`
    * Change return type of `palindrome` to `int`
    * Initialize `j` to `strlen(word) - 1`
    * Change `return -1` to `return 0`
    * Change `%c` in 2nd `printf` in `main` to `%d`
* _Write a function called `molecular_formula` that takes a string containing the constituent atoms of a molecule and updates the string to contain the molecular formula. For example, the string `"HHO"` should be changed to `"H20"`, and the string `"HHSOOOO"` should be changed to `"H2SO4"`. You can assume:_
    * _Molecules will only contain elements that are represented by a single letter — e.g., a molecule may contain `'H'` but not `"Na"`_
    * _All atoms of the same element are listed consecutively — e.g., the constituent atoms may be provided as `"HHO"` but not `"HOH"`_
    * _The elements are listed in the order they should appear in the molecular formula — e.g., the constituent atoms `"HHO"` are changed to the molecular formula `"H2O"`, whereas the constituent atoms `"OHH"` are changed to the molecular formula `"OH2"`_
    * _There will be at most 9 atoms of each element — e.g., `"H9C9"` may occur, but `"H10C11"` will not occur_
    ```C
    void molecular_formula(char elements[]) {
        int count = 1;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= strlen(elements); i++) {
            if (elements[i] != elements[i-1]) {
                elements[j] = elements[i-1];
                j++;
                if (count > 1) {
                    elements[j] = count + '0';
                    j++;
                }
                count = 0;
            }
            count++;
        }
        elements[j] = '\0';
    }
    ```

## Number base conversions
_Perform the following conversions_
* `97` to 8-bit unsigned binary = `0b01100001`
* `-42` to 8-bit two's complement = `0b11010110`
* `0b11001100` to unsigned decimal = `128 + 64 + 8 + 4` = `204`
* `0b11001100` to signed decimal = `-52`
* `0x27` to unsigned decimal = `39`
* `0xDEAD` to 16-bit binary = `0b1101111010101101`

## Structs
* _Define a struct for representing a chemical element, which includes the element's:_
    * _Name_
    * _Chemical symbol_
    * _Atomic number_
    * _State (solid, liquid, or gas) at room temperature_
    ```C
    struct element {
        char name[20];
        char symbol[3];
        int number;
        char state;
    };
    ```
* _Write a function called `lookup` that takes a chemical symbol and an array containing a struct for each of the 118 elements in the periodic table. The function should return the specified element's atomic number. If the provided symbol does not correspond to a known element, the function should return -1._
    ```C
    int lookup(char symbol[], struct element table[]) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 118; i++) {
            if (strcmp(symbol, table[i].symbol) == 0) {
                return table[i].number;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    ```
