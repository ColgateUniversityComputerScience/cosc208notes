ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the above question; if you have extra time take a few deep breaths to help reduce stress.


## Cache replacement
_Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4. Assuming the cache is initially empty, what is the hit ratio for each of the following algorithms?_
* _Optimal_
    ```




    ```
* Q2: _FIFO_
    ```




    ```
* Q3: _LRU_
    ```




    ```
* Q4: _LFU_
