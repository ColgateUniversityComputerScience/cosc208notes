```


Q23: _Write a function called `sign` that takes a number expressed in binary using two's complement and returns `-1` if the number is negative, `0` if the number is zero, or `1` if the number is positive. The binary is stored as a character array that starts with `0b` and contains an arbitrary number of `'0'` and `'1'` characters._
