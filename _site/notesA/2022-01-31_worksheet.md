# C: stack frames; using libraries

## Warm-up
This warm-up focuses on the biological process of cell division

Q1: _Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._
```C









```

Q2: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have ta least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._
```C











```

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the warm-up; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Program stack example
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int multiply(int z) {
    return z * 5 / 9;
}
int subtract(int x, int y) {
    return x - y;
}
int convert(int t) {
    int u = subtract(t, 32);
    int v = multiply(u);
    return v;
}
int main() {
    int f = 68;
    int c = convert(68);
    printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
}
```

## Program stack practice
Q3: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_
```C
int squared(int base) {
    return base * base;
}
int dbl(int num) {
    printf("%d x 2\n", num);
    return num * 2;   
}
int two(int exponent) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
        result = dbl(result);
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    int n = 3;
    int s = squared(3);
    printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
    int t = two(3);
    printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
}
```

Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int copy(int a, int b) {
    a = b;
    return a;
}
int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 7;
    int z = copy(x, y);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
}
```

Q5: __Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "n=2"_
```C
int recurse(int n) {
    printf("n=%d\n", n);
    if (n == 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        return 1 + recurse(n/2);
    }
}
int main() {
    int x = 16;
    int r = recurse(x);
    printf("result=%d\n", r);
}
```

Q6: _If `main` initialized `x` to `64` (instead of `16`), how many stack frames would exist immediately before the program printed "n=2"?_
```

```

## Extra practice
Q7: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 9, the program's output would be:_

```
\       /
 \     /
  \   /
   \ /
    X
   / \
  /   \
 /     \
/       \
```
