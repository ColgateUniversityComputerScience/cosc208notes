_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2021-11-05_

## Announcements
* Project 2 Part B due Tuesday

## Outline
* Limited direct execution
* System calls
* Process abstraction
* Creating processes

## No warm-up: Happy Friday!

## Accessing hardware
* Recall: OS is responsible for allocating/managing the hardware
    * ⇒ applications should **not have unfettered access to hardware**
* Example: execute an instruction on the CPU
    * Allow the application to execute instructions in a "supervised" manner
* Example: accessing the solid state drive (SSD)
    * Ask the OS to access the SSD on the application's behalf—latency of accessing SSD (~1 million CPU cycles) far outweighs the extra instructions required for OS to perform the access on the application's behalf
* Mechanisms
    * Limited Direct Execution
    * System calls

## Limited Direct Execution
* CPU has two modes of execution: user mode & kernel mode
* _When does a CPU run in user mode?_ — when executing application code
* _When does a CPU run in kernel mode?_ — when executing OS code
* Allowable operations in user mode are restricted
    * Applications can...
        * Perform arithmetic/logic operations
        * Load/store values in its stack/heap
    * Applications must ask the OS to...
        * Start/terminate applications
        * Create/delete files
        * Display output on screen
        * Read input from user
    * Must transfer control to the OS to perform these operations — How?

## System calls
* Invoked via a special assembly instruction: trap (generic) or `svc` (on ARM)
    * Example program
        ```C
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        int user() {
            int uid = getuid();
            return uid;
        }
        int main() {
            int u = user();
            printf("User %d is running this process\n", u);
        }
        ```
    * Assembly code
        ```
        00000000004006ac <user>:
            4006ac:	d10083ff 	sub	sp, sp, #0x20
            4006b0:	f9000bfe 	str	x30, [sp, #16]
            4006b4:	94007713 	bl	41e300 <__getuid>
            4006b8:	b9000fe0 	str	w0, [sp, #12]
            4006bc:	b9400fe0 	ldr	w0, [sp, #12]
            4006c0:	f9400bfe 	ldr	x30, [sp, #16]
            4006c4:	910083ff 	add	sp, sp, #0x20
            4006c8:	d65f03c0 	ret
        000000000041e300 <__getuid>:
            41e300:	d28015c8 	mov	x8, #0xae
            41e304:	d4000001 	svc	#0x0
            41e308:	d65f03c0 	ret
        ```
    * Functions in the C standard library that involve a privileged operation (e.g., `printf`) put the system call number in a register and invoke a trap instruction — programmer doesn’t have to worry about these details; they can just call the appropriate function in the C standard library
* When `svc` is executed
    1. CPU saves registers to the kernel stack — kernel stack is at a fixed location in memory
        * _Why do we need to save the registers?_ — so we can return to `user` when `__getuid` is done
    2. CPU switches to kernel mode
    3. CPU uses system call number to index into table of trap handlers 
        * At boot, initialize table of trap handlers with pointers into OS code for handling each type of syscall
    4. Branch and link to trap handler code
    5. CPU restores registers from the kernel stack
    6. CPU switches to user mode
    7. Resume execution after `svc` 
* _What should we do if a process tries to perform a privileged operation without making a system call?_
    * Let the code keep running — code may assume privileged operation was successful
    * Kill the process

## Process abstraction
* Process — running program and its corresponding machine state (code, memory, and register values)
    * Program is static code and static data; process is dynamic instance of code and data
    * Cooking analogy
        * Recipe == program
        * Following a recipe == process
        * Ingredients == program inputs
        * Prepared food == program outputs
        * Cabinets, fridge, etc. == persistent storage
        * Prep area (e.g., counter) == registers & main memory
        * Contents and status of the prep area; current step of recipe == machine state
        * Chef == CPU
    * Can have multiple processes all running different instances of the same program
        * Cooking analogy — chef may be making multiple batches of the same recipe
* OS is responsible for...
    * Creating processes — when a user or another application requests it
    * Scheduling processes — i.e., deciding when/which process should be allowed to use the CPU
    * Switching processes — i.e., saving the machine state of one process and restoring the machine state of another process; called context switching
    * Cleaning-up processes — i.e., releasing any resources they are using when the process is done
    * Interacting with I/O devices (e.g., disks, NICs, graphics card) on behalf of processes
* Q1: _Consider building a Lego kit as an analogy for operating systems' process abstraction. Match each component of the analogy with the corresponding component of a real computer system._
    * Instruction booklet == program
    * Following the assembly instructions == process
    * Lego bricks == program inputs
    * Completed kit == program outputs
    * Cabinet/drawers for storing Legos == persistent storage
    * Building area (e.g., tabletop) == registers and main memory
    * Current step for the instruction booklet == program counter
    * You == CPU

## Creating processes
* `int fork()`
    * Creates an exact copy of the running process, except for the return value from `fork` — return `0` to child (i.e., new) process; return child’s process ID to parent process (i.e., process that called fork)
    * Both child and parent resume execution from place where `fork` was called
* Q2: _What does the following code output?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Before fork\n");
        int pid = fork();
        printf("After fork\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Before fork
    After fork
    After fork
    ```
* Q3: _What does the following code output (assuming the new process has PID 1819)?_
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Before fork");
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child gets %d\n", pid);
        } else {
            printf("Parent gets %d\n", pid);
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Before fork
    Child gets 0
    Parent gets 1819
    ```
    OR
    ```
    Before fork
    Parent gets 1819
    Child gets 0
    ``` 
* Creating an exponentially increasing number of processes (known as a _fork bomb_)
    ```C
    int main() {
        while(1) {
            fork();
        }
    }
