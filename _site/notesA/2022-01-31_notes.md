## Outline
* Warm-up
* Stack frames

## Warm-up
* This warm-up focuses on the biological process of cell division
* Q1: _Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._
    ```C
    int cells(int rounds) {
        int total = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < rounds; i++) {
            total = total * 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```
* Q2: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have at least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._
    ```C
    int rounds(int cells) {
        int total = 1;
        int rounds = 0;
        while (total < cells) {
            total *= 2;
            rounds++;
        }
        return rounds;
    }
    ```

## Using libraries

## Program stack
* Stores data for functions that are currently executing
* Stored in random access memory (RAM)
* Composed of stack frames
    * A stack frame contains the values stored in a functions's local variables and formal parameters
    * The size of the stack frame is determined by the number and type of local variables and formal parameters
    * A stack frame is added to the top of the stack when a function is called
    * A stack frame is removed from the top fo the stack when a function returns
* Example
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int multiply(int z) {
        return z * 5 / 9;
    }
    int subtract(int x, int y) {
        return x - y;
    }
    int convert(int t) {
        int u = subtract(t, 32);
        int v = multiply(u);
        return v;
    }
    int main() {
        int f = 68;
        int c = convert(68);
        printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
    }
    ```
* C is pass-by-value → changes made to a variable inside a function will not be preserved outside of the function
* Q3: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_
    ```C
    int squared(int base) {
        return base * base;
    }
    int dbl(int num) {
        printf("%d x 2\n", num);
        return num * 2;   
    }
    int two(int exponent) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
            result = dbl(result);
        }
        return result;
    }
    int main() {
        int n = 3;
        int s = squared(3);
        printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
        int t = two(3);
        printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
    }
    ```
* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int copy(int a, int b) {
        a = b;
        return a;
    }
    int main() {
        int x = 3;
        int y = 7;
        int z = copy(x, y);
        printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
    }
    ```
    ```
    3 7 7
    ```
* Q5: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "n=2"_
    ```C
    int recurse(int n) {
        printf("n=%d\n", n);
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        else {
            return 1 + recurse(n/2);
        }
    }
    int main() {
        int x = 16;
        int r = recurse(x);
        printf("result=%d\n", r);
    }
    ```
* Q6: _If `main` initialized `x` to `64` (instead of `16`), how many stack frames would exist immediately before the program printed "n=2"?_
    7 —  (bottom) `main`, `recurse(64)`, `recurse(32)`, `recurse(16)`, `recurse(8)`, `recurse(4)`, `recurse(2)` (top)
* _What does your answer to questions 5 and 6 tell you about program efficiency?_ — the more nested function calls there are, the more stack memory the program requires; creating an iterative (instead of recursive) implementation would be more memory efficient

## Extra practice
* Q7: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 9, the program's output would be:_
    ```
    \       /
     \     /
      \   /
       \ /
        X
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    /       \
    ```
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    void print_x_helper(int n, int r) {
        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            if (c == r) {
                printf("\\");
            }
            else if (c == n-1-r) {
                printf("/");
            }
            else {
                printf(" " );
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    void print_x(int n) {
        int r = 0;
        while (r < n/2) {
            print_x_helper(n, r);
            r++;
        }
        for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            if (c == r) {
                printf("X");
            }
            else {
                printf(" ");
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
        r++;
        while (r < n) {
            print_x_helper(n, r);
            r++;
        }
    }
    ```
