## Warm-up
Q1: _Write a function called `count_words` that takes a string and counts the number of words in the string. Assume each word is separated by a single space, and the string will contain at least one word. For example, `"Today is Wednesday."` contains 3 words._
```C
int count_words(char str[]) {
    int words = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == ' ') {
            words++;
        }
    }
    return words;
}
```

## Structs
* _How is a struct declared?_
    ```C
    struct tvshow {
        char name[100];
        int season;
    };
    ```
* _How are fields of the struct accessed?_ — with the dot (.) operator
    ```C
    struct tvshow favorite;
    strncpy(favorite.name, "Tiny House Nation", 100);
    favorite.season = 6;
    ```
* A struct is a collection of values; it is **not** an object, and hence cannot have methods associated with it
* A struct variable holds *values* for the fields of the struct; it is **not** a reference to the struct, and hence a copy of the values are passed to functions
* Q2: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    struct one {
        char x;
        char y;
        short z;
    };
    struct two {
        int m;
        int n[10];
    };
    int main() {
        struct one a;
        struct two b;
        printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(struct one), sizeof(a.z));
        printf("%d %d\n", sizeof(b), sizeof(b.n));
    }
    ```
    ```
    4 2
    44 40
    ```
* Q3: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    struct alpha {
        char x[10];
        int y;
    };
    struct beta {
        int b;
        int c;
    };
    int main() {
        struct alpha a = { "Colgate", 13 };
        struct beta b = { 1, 2 };
        struct beta c = { 3, 4 };
        a.y += -13;
        b.b = 5;
        c = b;
        b.c = 6;
        printf("a %s %d\n", a.x, a.y);
        printf("b %d %d\n", b.b, b.c);
        printf("c %d %d\n", c.b, c.c);
    }
    ```
    ```
    a Colgate 0
    b 5 6
    c 5 2
    ```

## Decimal (i.e., base 10)
* _How many unique values can you represent with one decimal digit?_ -- 10
* _How do you count to 13 (in base 10)?_ -- 0 (computers like to start at zero!), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (notice the "ones" place becomes zero and the "tens" place becomes 1), 11, 12, 13

## Binary (i.e., base 2)
* We are used to working with decimal numbers, but computers represent numbers in binary
    * A single binary digit (_bit_) can represent two unique values — 0 or 1
    * It is easier to build hardware that uses polar opposites (e.g., on/off, high/low voltage, positive/negative magnetism, etc.) than multiple levels (e.g., very high, high, moderately high, moderate, moderately low, low, very low voltage)
* _How many unique values can be represented with 2 bits?_ — 00, 01, 10, 00; 2^2 = 4
    * _3 bits?_ — 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111; 2^3 = 8
* Practice powers of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192
* _How many bits are in a byte?_ -- 8 bits
* _How many unique values can be represented with 1 byte? 4 bytes? -- 256, ~4.3 billion
* _How do you count to 13 in binary?_ -- 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101
* _Convert these binary numbers to decimal (i.e., base 10):_
    * Q4: `0b10` = 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 2
    * Q5: `0b11` = 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 2 + 1 = 3
    * Q6: `0b1010` = 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10
    * Q7: `0b1111` = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15
    * Q8: `0b11001100` = 1 * 2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 0 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 128 + 64 + 8 + 4 = 204

## Extra practice
* Q14: _Write a struct definition to represent a date (year, month number, and day)._
    ```C
    struct date {
        int year;
        int month;
        int day;
    };
    ```
* Q15: _Write a function called `compare` that takes two date structs and returns -1 if the first date occurs before the second, 0 if the dates are equal, and 1 if the first date occurs after the second._
    ```C
    int compare(struct date a, struct date b) {
        if (a.year < b.year) {
            return -1;
        } else if (b.year < a.year) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            if (a.month < b.month) {
                return -1;
            } else if (b.month < a.month) {
                return 1;
            } else { 
                if (a.day < b.day) {
                    return -1;
                } else if (b.day < a.day) {
                    return 1;
                } else {
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
