## Outline
* Warm-up
* Review mid-semester feedback
* Heap memory deallocation
* Pointers to structs

## Warm-up
_Assume you wanted to write a function that creates a copy of a string. What is wrong with each of the following attempts at writing such a function?_
* Q1:
    ```C
    char *copy1(char strA[]) {
        char strB[strlen(strA) + 1];
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return strB;
    }
    ```
    You cannot return a locally-declared array
* Q2:
    ```C
    char copy2(char strA[]) {
        char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(strA) + 1));
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return *strB;
    }
    ```
    Returns the first character in the copy, instead of an array of characters
* Q3:
    ```C
    char *copy3(char strA[]) {
        char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char *));
        strcpy(strB, strA);
        return strB;
    }
    ```
    Allocates space for a pointer, not space for the number of characters in strA

## free
* `void free(void *block)`
* When to free? — when a value stored on the heap is no longer needed
    * Free memory regions as soon as you are done
    * Do not read/write the memory location after it has been freed!
* Q4: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    free(ptrA);
    free(ptrB);
    ```
    Double free — `ptrA` and `ptrB` point to the same heap region
* Q5: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    ptr[0] = 1;
    free(ptr);
    ptr[1] = 2;
    ```
    Access after free — heap region is freed, then used again
* Q6: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    ptr++;
    free(ptr);
    ```
    Not pointing to beginning of allocated region when calling free
* Q7: _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in this code snippet?_
    ```C
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    ptrA[0] = 0;
    ptrB[1] = 1;
    free(ptrA);
    ptrB[2] = 2;
    ```
    Access after free — `ptrA` and `ptrB` point to the same heap region

## Pointers to structs
* _How do you get a pointer to a struct?_
    * Use address-of (`&`) operator with a parameter/local variable
        ```C
        struct tvshow {
            char name[100];
            int season;
        };
        ```
        ```C
        int main() {
            struct tvshow favorite = {"This Old House", 42};
            struct tvshow *ptr = &favorite;
        }
        ```
    * Allocate space on the heap
        ```C
        int main() {
            struct tvshow *ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct tvshow));
        }
        ```
* _How do you access a struct's fields through a pointer to the struct?_
    * `(*ptr).field`
        ```C
        printf("There are %d seasons of %s\n", (*ptr).seasons, (*ptr).name);
        ```
        * Don't do `*ptr.field` — it will try to dereference `field` not `ptr`, because `.` has higher precedence than `*`
    * `ptr->field`
        ```C
        printf("There are %d seasons of %s\n", ptr->seasons, ptr->name);
        ```

## Extra practice
* _Two structs have been defined representing a queue and an item on a queue._
    ```C
    struct item {
        int value;
        struct item *next;
    };
    struct queue {
        struct item *head;
        struct item *tail;
    };
    ```
    _The `new_queue` function creates a new, empty queue._
    ```C
    struct queue *new_queue() {
        struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
        q->head = NULL;
        q->tail = NULL;
        return q;
    }
    ```
* Q10: _Write a function called `enqueue` that adds a new value at the end of the queue._
    ```C
    void enqueue(int value, struct queue *q) {
        struct item *i = malloc(sizeof(struct item));
        i->value = value;
        i->next = NULL;
        if (q->tail == NULL) {
            q->head = i;
            q->tail = i;
        } else {
            q->tail->next = i;
            q->tail = i;
        }
    }
    ```
* Q11: _Write a function called `dequeue` that removes and returns the value at the head of the queue. The function should return -1 if the queue is empty._
    ```C
    int dequeue(struct queue *q) {
        if (NULL == q->head) {
            return -1;
        }
        struct item *i = q->head;
        int v = i->value;
        q->head = i->next;
        if (q->head == NULL) {
            q->tail = NULL;
        }
        free(i);
        return v;
    }
    ```
* Q12: _Write a function called `free_queue` that empties and frees a queue._
    ```C
    void free_stack(struct queue *q) {
        while (q->head != NULL) {
            dequeue(q);
        }
        free(q);
    }
    ```
