_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2021-08-30_

## Announcements
* Before next class: read DiS sections and answer **individually** pre-class questions

* Is there any volunteer to switch from 208LC to LB?
 

## Outline
* Syllabus
* Warm-up: Hello, system
* Hello, C

## Syllabus

* _Questions_
* Remarks
    * advantage 2D layout: facilitate skimming
    * pre-questions: You need to earn ≥ 80% of the available points to get full credit. Trust you are doing right thing to learn. 
    * project: in pair by default
    * participation also includes _listening_, we share a space

## Warm-up

* Q1: _What are the main components of a computer system?_
    * Operating system (OS)
    * Central processing unit (CPU)
    * Random access memory (RAM)
    * Secondary storage devices — e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive
    * Input/output (I/O) ports
* Q1b: _What is the role of each of the components?_
    * OS — manages hardware resources
    * CPU — executes assembly instructions
    * RAM — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage — stores program data (code, documents, etc.) persistently
    * I/O ports — receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)

* Q2: _What do you think of when you hear the term “Computer Systems”?_
    * C
    * Number representation
    * Program memory
    * Architecture
    * Assembly
    * Efficiency
    * Multiprocessing
    * Networking
* Q3: _Why is it important to learn about computer systems?_
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism

## Hello, C


## Primitive types
* Most common types
    * `char` — 1 byte (8-bits); integers -128...127; integers 0...127 correspond to ASCII characters
    * `int` — usually 4 bytes (32-bits); integers -2 billion...2 billion
    * `long `— usually 8 bytes (64-bits); integers -9 quintillion...9 quintillion
* Add `unsigned` in front of these types for a range from 0 to 255, 4 billion, or 18 quintillion, respectively

## Operators
* _How would I increment the number stored in a variable `x` by `1`?_
    * `x = x + 1`
    * `x += 1`
    * `x++`
    * `++x`


* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 2;
        x = x+5;
        printf("%d ", x);        
        x = y*2;
        printf("%d ", x);
        x *= 5;
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", x--);
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", --x);
        printf("%d", x);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```

## Demo

* Write a C program that prints "Hello, C!"

    ```C
    // Visual Studio Code demo
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, C!\n");
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```
* _How do you compile the program?_
    ```bash
    $ clang -g -Wall -o hello hello.c
    ```
* _How do you run the program?_
    ```bash
    $ ./hello
    ```

## More practice

* Q5: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        int y = x/2;
        int z = x%2;
        printf("%d %d\n", y, z);
    }
    ```
    ```

* Q6: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        char y = 'F';
        y = y - x;
        printf("%c %d\n", y, y);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```
## Output (if time)
* What is the syntax for `printf`?
    * `printf(FORMAT_STRING, VALUES, ...);`
    * `FORMAT_STRING` is a string constant (sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes) that may optionally include format specifiers
    * Format specifiers define how to convert a value to a string
        * `%d` decimal (i.e., base 10) number
        * `%c` character
        * `%x` hexadecimal (i.e., base 16) number
        * `%s` string — more on this next week
    * After the format string, include a value for each format specifier
        * A compile error will occur if the number of format specifiers does not match the number of values
        * A compile warning will occur if the value type does not match the format specifier
* Next week we'll talk about reading input using `fgets`
    * _Dive into Systems_ uses `scanf`, which has several disadvantage
    
## Extra practice
* Q5: _Write a program that computes and displays the number of minutes in a year._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int minutes = 365 * 24 * 60;
        printf("%d minutes\n", minutes);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```
