Q1: _Fill-in the truth tables for all six types of gates_

| A | B | (A AND B) | (A OR B) | (NOT A) | (A NAND B) | (A NOR B) | (A XOR B) |
| - | - | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0 | 0 |           |          |         |            |           |           | 
| 0 | 1 |           |          |         |            |           |           | 
| 1 | 0 |           |          |         |            |           |           | 
| 1 | 1 |           |          |         |            |           |           |
