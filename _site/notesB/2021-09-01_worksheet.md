## Outline
* Warm-up
* Output
* Control structures

## Warm-up

Q1: _Write a program that prints the number of days, hours, and minutes in a week._

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    




}
```

## Output practice

Q2: _Use `printf` to output today's date (e.g., `2021-1-29`)_
```C
   
```

Q3: _Use `printf` to output the dimensions of a college basketball court (`94ft x 50ft`)_
```C
     

```

Q4: _Use `printf` to output a patient's first and last initial and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (e.g., `A.G. 115/70`)_
```C

```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 


## Control structures practice


Q5: _Write a program that flips a coin: call `random()` to generate a random number, and print `heads` if the number is even and `tails` if the number is odd._ 

```C
#include <        >
#include <        >
    









```

Q6: _Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop._

```C
#include <stdio.h>
    




```

Q7: _Write a program that prints every letter of the alphabet in upper and lower case: `AaBbCcDd...YyZz`_
```C








```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 


Q8: _Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100, except:_
* _If the number is divisible by 3 then print `Three`_
* _If the number is divisible by 5 then print `Five`_
* _If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print `Both`_

```C




















```



## Extra practice

Q9: _Write a program that prints out the powers of 2 from 2 through 2048._


Q10: _Write the same program as in Q6 using a while loop._

```C
#include <stdio.h>
    




```
