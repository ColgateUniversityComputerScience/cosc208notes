## Outline
* Warm-up
* Pointers
* Pointers as parameters
* Extra practice

## Pointers
* A special type of variable that holds a memory address
    * A pointer "points to" a location in memory
* Declaration consists of:
    * Type of value stored in memory at the address stored in the pointer variable
    * Asterisk (`*`)
    * Name of pointer variable
    * Example: `int *p` --- declares a pointer variable `p` that refers to a memory location where an integer is stored
* Can be used to indirectly read and write another variable
* Address-of (`&`) operator obtains the memory address where a variable is stored
    Example: 
    ```C
    int i = 42;
    int *p = &i; // p now contains the address 
                 //where the value of variable i is stored 
                 //p “points-to” i
    ```
* De-reference (*) operator is used to refer to the value stored at the memory address contained in the pointer variable
    * Example: 
        ```C
        printf("%d\n",*p); // Outputs 42, because p contains the memory address where i is stored (i.e., p points-to i), and the variable i currently contains the value 42
        ```
    * Example: 
        ```C
        *p = *p + 1; // Updates the value in variable i to 43, because p contains the memory address where i is stored (i.e., p points-to i)
        ```
* _What happens if we assign a value to the pointer variable without dereferencing the pointer?_ --- we update the memory address stored in the pointer variable; we point to a new location in memory

## Practice with pointers
* Q1: _Write a snippet of code that:_
    1. _Declares a `char` variable called `orig` and initializes it with the value `'A'`_
    2. _Declares and initializes a pointer called `ptr` that points to `orig`_
    3. _Uses the pointer to update the value stored in `orig` to `'B'`_
    ```C
    char orig = 'A';
    char *ptr = &orig;
    *ptr = 'B';
    ```
* Q2: _What is the output of this program?_ -- draw a memory diagram to help
    ```C
    int main() {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        char c = 'C';
        int *x = &a;
        int *y = &b;
        char *z = &c;
        printf("%d %d %c\n", *x, *y, *z);
        *x += 1;
        b += 2;
        *z = 'D';
        printf("%d %d %c\n", *x, *y, *z);
        printf("%d %d %c\n", a, b, c);
        x = y;
        *x += 10;
        a += 20;
        printf("%d %d\n", *x, *y);
        printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
    }
    ```
    Output
    ```
    1 2 C
    2 4 D
    2 4 D
    14 14
    22 14
    ```

<!--
* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int a = 1; // Assume at 0x4
        int *x = &a; // Assume at 0x8
        int **y = &x; // Assume at 0xC
        printf("%p %p %p\n", a, x ,y);
        printf("%p %p\n", *x , *y);
    }
    ```
    Output
    ```
    0x1 0x4 0x8
    0x1 0x4
    ```

## Pointers as parameters
* Functions can take pointers as parameters
    * Similar to a pointer declaration, include an asterisk before the paramter name: e.g., `void foo(int *a)`
    * Function gets a copy of the memory address stored in the pointer variable, not a copy of the value stored at that memory address
* Example
    ```C
    void value(int a) {
        a = 2;
    }
    void pointer(int *b) {
        *b = 3;
    }
    int main() {
        int v = 1;
        int *p = &v;
        value(v);
        printf("%d\n", v);
        pointer(p);
        printf("%d\n", v);
    }
    ```

## Extra practice
* Q6: _Write a function called `transfer` that takes two integer pointers and an amount to transfer and moves the specified amount from one integer to the other._
    ```C
    void transfer(int *from, int *to, int amount) {
        *from -= amount;
        *to += amount;
    }
    ```
* Q7: _Write a function called `swap` that takes two integer pointers and exchanges the integer values._
    ```C
    void swap(int *a, int *b) {
        int tmp = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = tmp;
    }
    ```
