## Warm-up
Q1: _For each of the following instances of caching, indicate whether the caching is motivated by temporal or spatial locality._
* A CPU caches the first 32 instructions of a function when the function is called
* A CPU caches all of the instructions for a frequently called function
* A web browser caches the Moodle pages for your courses, which you view multiple times per week
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches a video that has gone viral
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches "recommended videos" related to a popular video

* _Optimal_
* Q2: _FIFO_
* Q3: _LRU_
* Q4: _LFU_
