## Warm-up

* Q1: _What does the following program output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct coords {
    int x;
    int y;
};
struct coords *flip(struct coords *in) {
    struct coords *out = malloc(sizeof(struct coords));
    out->x = in->y;
    out->y = in->x;
    return out;
}
struct coords *modify(struct coords *point) {
    point->x *= 2;
    point->y *= 2;
    return point;
}
int main() {
    struct coords *one = malloc(sizeof(struct coords));
    one->x = 3;
    one->y = 4;
    struct coords *two = flip(one);
    printf("one %d, %d\n", one->x, one->y);
    printf("two %d, %d\n", two->x, two->y);
    struct coords *three = modify(two);
    three->y = one->y;
    one->x = 5;
    printf("one %d, %d\n", one->x, one->y);
    printf("two %d, %d\n", two->x, two->y);
    printf("three %d, %d\n", three->x, three->y);
}
```

    one 3, 4
    two 4, 3
    one 5, 4
    two 8, 4
    three 8, 4


## von Neumann Architecture

<img src="https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/_images/vonNArch.png" width="400px" />

* _Where are instructions stored prior to execution?_ — memory unit
    * Instructions are loaded from input unit into memory unit when a program starts
* _Where are instructions stored during execution?_ — instruction register
* _Where is data stored when it is not in use?_ — memory unit
* _Where is data stored when it is being operated on?_ — (general purpose) registers
* Notice: instructions and data are both stored in the memory unit, but there are different registers for instructions and data in the CPU
* Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle
    * _What happens in the fetch stage?_ — The control unit loads the next instruction from memory, based on the program counter, into the instruction register
    * _What happens in the decode stage?_ — break instruction into operation and operands
    * _What happens in the execute stage?_ — The ALU performs the operation on the operands
    * Store stage does not occur in an ARM processor

## Hardware building blocks

* Transistors — switches that control electrical flow; output state depends on current state plus input state
* Logic gates — created from transistors; implement boolean operations (AND, NO, NOT, etc.)
* Circuit — created from logic gates
* Processing and control units — created from circuits

## Logic gates

* Q2: _Fill-in the truth tables for all six types of logic gates_

| A | B | A AND B | A OR B | NOT A | A NAND B | A NOR B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |    0    |   0    |   1   |     1    |    1    |    0    | 
| 0 | 1 |    0    |   1    |   1   |     1    |    0    |    1    | 
| 1 | 0 |    0    |   1    |   0   |     1    |    0    |    1    | 
| 1 | 1 |    1    |   1    |   0   |     0    |    0    |    0    | 

* Q3: _How do you use AND and NOT gates to create a NAND gate?_

* Q4: _How do you use OR and NOT gates to create a NOR gate?_

## Extra practice

* _Two structs have been defined representing a queue and an item on a queue._


```c
struct item {
    int value;
    struct item *next;
};
struct queue {
    struct item *head;
    struct item *tail;
};
```

* _The `new_queue` function creates a new, empty queue._


```c
struct queue *new_queue() {
    struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
    q->head = NULL;
    q->tail = NULL;
    return q;
}
```

* Q5: _Write a function called `enqueue` that adds a new value at the end of the queue._

* Q6: _Write a function called `dequeue` that removes and returns the value at the head of the queue. The function should return -1 if the queue is empty._

* Q7: _Write a function called `free_queue` that empties and frees a queue._

* Q8: _Write a function called `position` that takes a value and a queue and returns the position of the value within the queue (the head of the queue is position 0). Return -1 if the value is not present in the queue._


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
struct item {
    int value;
    struct item *next;
};
struct queue {
    struct item *head;
    struct item *tail;
};

struct queue *new_queue() {
    struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
    q->head = NULL;
    q->tail = NULL;
    return q;
}

void enqueue(int value, struct queue *q) {
    struct item *i = malloc(sizeof(struct item));
    i->value = value;
    i->next = NULL;
    if (q->tail == NULL) {
        q->head = i;
        q->tail = i;
    } else {
        q->tail->next = i;
        q->tail = i;
    }
}

int dequeue(struct queue *q) {
    if (NULL == q->head) {
        return -1;
    }
    struct item *i = q->head;
    int v = i->value;
    q->head = i->next;
    if (q->head == NULL) {
        q->tail = NULL;
    }
    free(i);
    return v;
}

void free_queue(struct queue *q) {
    while (q->head != NULL) {
        dequeue(q);
    }
    free(q);
}

int position(int value, struct queue *q) {
    struct item *curr = q->head;
    int index = 0;
    while (curr != NULL) {
        if (curr->value == value) {
            return index;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
        index++;
    }
    return -1;
}

// Testing
#include <assert.h>
int main() {
    struct queue *q = new_queue();
    enqueue(1, q);
    enqueue(2, q);
    assert(dequeue(q) == 1);
    enqueue(3, q);
    enqueue(4, q);
    assert(dequeue(q) == 2);
    assert(dequeue(q) == 3);
}
```
