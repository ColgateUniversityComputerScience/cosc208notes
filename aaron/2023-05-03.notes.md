* Cloud computing

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw a diagram of a system that does **not** use a hypervisor._

* Q2: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 1 hypervisor**._

* Q3: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 2 hypervisor**._

* Q4: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **container**._

## Data centers

* _What is a data center?_ — a large collection of computer systems housed in a single physical location
* Primary components
    * Servers — with multi-core CPU, main memory, secondary storage, and network interface card (NIC)
    * Racks — cabinet containing tens of servers
    * Rows — line of racks
    * Network — routers, switches, and fiber optic cables connecting servers/racks together to allow them to exchange data
        * Includes connectivity to other data centers and the Internet
    * Power system — electrical wires, distribution units, generators, connections to the power grid
    * Cooling system — fans, cooling units (mechanical, evaporative, outdoor air, etc.)
* Resources can be pooled together to provide more computing and storage than a single server
    * Application can be replicated on many servers (running many processes) to handle a large volume of data/users and provide fault-tolerance
    * Main memory on many servers can be pooled together to provide the abstraction of large, low-latency storage
    * Files can be distributed/replicated across secondary storage on many servers to handle a large volume of data and provide fault-tolerance

## Cloud computing

* Characteristics
    * Resources available on-demand — tenants reserve resources only when they need them
        * E.g., a company uses more virtual machines during the day when employees are using applications
        * E.g., a website has more visitors during a sale or popular event
    * Pay-per-use — only pay for the resources you use
        * E.g., pay for a virtual machine per hour of use
        * E.g., pay for storage per GB per month
    * Shared & virtualized — physical servers and storage devices resources are used by multiple tenants
        * E.g., multiple virtual machines run on the same machine
        * Physical servers and storage are usually more isolated than network switches and links
* Service models
    * Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
        * Tenants lease virtual machines, virtual storage, and virtual networks
        * Tenants must manage the operating system, file system, etc.
        * E.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine
    * Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
        * Tenants lease resources to run applications written in a specific language — Python, Java, Hadoop/MapReduce
        * Cloud provider manages the operating system, file system, and network
        * E.g., Google App Engine, Cloud Foundry, IBM Cloud
    * Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) or serverless
        * Tenants run independent snippets of code
        * E.g., Amazon Lambda
    * Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
        * Tenants lease access to specific software
        * E.g., Salesforce, Concur, Constant Contact, Google Drive, Office 365
    * Storage-as-a-Service (STaaS)
        * E.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud
    * Ownership
        * Public - anyone can request and use resources
        * Private - resources are only available to tenants (e.g., departments) within a company or organization
        * Hybrid - tenants use a combination of public and private cloud resources

_For each of the following service providers, indicate what type of service they offer._

* Q5: _Box provides secure file sharing and storage_

    Storage-as-a-Service (STaaS)

* Q6: _Microsoft Azure provides virtual machines running Windows or Linux_

    Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

* Q7: _Heroku allows tenants to deploy code written in Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, or Clojure_

    Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

* Q8: _Oracle Supply Chain Management (SCM) is software that allows businesses to manage their supply chain_

    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
