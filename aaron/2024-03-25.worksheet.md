_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2024-03-25_

## Announcements
* Project 2 due Wednesday @ 11pm
    * **Functionality**
        * Satisfactory: **two or fewer minor bugs** (see examples in project instructions)
        * Progressing: **two or fewer major bugs**
    * **Design**
        * Satisfactory: must adhere to **all** design criteria in the project instructions
        * Progressing: adheres to **most, but not all,** of the design criteria
    * **Academic Integrity**
        * “Set[ting] an example of ethical behavior in public and in private” is one of the 13 goals of a Colgate education. As part of this goal, Colgate has an **academic honor code** you are expected to follow. Additionally, “a computing professional should uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct”**.
        * You **may not share or copy code/answers from other students.** Violations of this policy will be considered facilitating academic misconduct and/or cheating according to the academic honor code.
        * You **must clearly indicate if any code is copied from or inspired by external sources** (e.g., Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) and adhere to the licensing requirements of such code. Violations of this policy will be considered cheating or plagiarism according to Colgate’s academic honor code.
        * **If you are struggling—due to a lack of understanding, time pressure, personal matters, etc.—please contact me. I want you to succeed, and I will do everything I can to help you.**

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Relationship between C variables and assembly code
* Instruction semantics
* Tracing assembly code

## Warm-up

* Q1: _For each line of assembly, indicate which original line of C code the assembly instruction was derived from._


```c
/* 1*/  #include <stdio.h>
/* 2*/  long deref(long *p) {
/* 3*/      long v = *p;
/* 4*/      return v;
/* 5*/  }
/* 6*/  int main() {
/* 7*/      long x = 2;
/* 8*/      long y = deref(&x);
/* 9*/      printf("y = %ld\n", y);
/*10*/      return 0;
/*11*/  }
```

```

## Relationship between C variables and assembly code

The following C program (`operands.c`) has been compiled into assembly:


```c
int operandsA(int a) {
    return a;
}
long operandsB(long b) {
    return b;
}
int operandsC(int *c) {
    return *c;
}
long operandsD(long *d) {
    return *d;
}
int main() {
    operandsA(5);
    operandsB(5);
    int x = 5;
    operandsC(&x);
    long y = 5;
    operandsD(&y);
}
```

```
