## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw a circuit that takes two 3-bit unsigned numbers (`0b A2 A1 A0` and `0b B2 B1 B0`) and outputs a single bit that indicates whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number. Assume you have access to an unlimited supply of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates and 1-bit greater-than, less-than, and equal-to circuits, as shown below_

## Extra practice

* Q2: _Draw a circuit that takes two 3-bit **signed** numbers (`0b A2 A1 A0` and `0b B2 B1 B0`) and outputs a single bit that indicates whether the first number is **greater than** the second number. Assume you have access to an unlimited supply of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates and 1-bit greater-than, less-than, and equal-to circuits._

* Q3: _Assume you have access to 1-bit circuits for `A < B`, `A == B`, and `A > B` and logic gates for `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. Draw a 2-bit circuit for `A < B` which uses the existing circuits and logic gates. Assume `A1` and `B1` are the most significant bits, and `A2` and `B2` are the least significant bits._
