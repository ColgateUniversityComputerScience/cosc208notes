# Architecture: n-bit circuits; multiplexers
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-10-11_

## Announcements
* Labs will **meet as usual** this week
* Project 2 due Thurs, Oct 19 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* n-bit circuits
* Multiplexer circuit

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Create a 1-bit circuit for `A <= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

## n-bit Logical Circuits

* Q2: _Complete the truth-table for `A > B` when A and B are two bits_

| A1 A0 | B1 B0 | A > B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   0 | 0   0 |   0   |
| 0   1 | 0   0 |   1   |
| 1   0 | 0   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   1 |       |
