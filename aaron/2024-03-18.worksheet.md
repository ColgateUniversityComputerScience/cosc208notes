* Warm-up
* Assembly
* Viewing assembly code
* Operands

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has two general purpose registers (r0 and r1) and supports four bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`). Assume you already have storage, MUX, DMUX, and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) circuits available as building blocks._

## Viewing assembly code

* Example program (`dogyears.c`)


```c
/* 1*/   #include <stdio.h>
/* 2*/   #include <stdlib.h>
/* 3*/   int dog_years(int birth) {
/* 4*/       int current = 2023;
/* 5*/       int years = current - birth;
/* 6*/       years = years * 7;
/* 7*/       return years;
/* 8*/   }
/* 9*/   int main() {
/*10*/       printf("What year were you born? ");
/*11*/       char year[5];
/*12*/       fgets(year, 5, stdin);
/*13*/       int dog_age = dog_years(atoi(year));
/*14*/       printf("You are %d dog years old\n", dog_age);
/*15*/   }
```

## Extra practice

* Q2: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has four general purpose registers (r0-r3) and supports four operations:_
    * `nop`: no operation; do nothing
    * `mov`: copy a value from one register to another
    * `movc`: store a constant value into a register, where the constant comes from the last four bits of the instruction
    * `add`: add the values in two registers and store the result in a register
