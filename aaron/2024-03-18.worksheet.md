## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has two general purpose registers (r0 and r1) and supports four bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`). Assume you already have storage, MUX, DMUX, and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) circuits available as building blocks._

## Extra practice

* Q2: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has four general purpose registers (r0-r3) and supports four operations:_
    * `nop`: no operation; do nothing
    * `mov`: copy a value from one register to another
    * `movc`: store a constant value into a register, where the constant comes from the last four bits of the instruction
    * `add`: add the values in two registers and store the result in a register
