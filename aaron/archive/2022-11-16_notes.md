    * Study guide posted on Moodle
    * Take-home portion: due Friday before class
    * In-class portion: Friday during **either class period (8:20am or 10:20am)**
* DEI Assignment 3 due Monday, Nov 29 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Memory hierarchy
* Reducing memory accesses
* Caching
* Processes
* Scheduling
* Threads
* Memory

## Memory hierarchy
* Q1: What is the **fastest volatile** memory? — registers
* Q2: What is the **fastest non-volatile** memory? — solid state drive (SSD)
* Q3: Why is a hard disk drive (HDD) slower than a solid state drive (SSD)? — an HDD has moving parts that need to be moved into position before data can be read/written
* Q4: Why is accessing main memory (i.e., Random Access Memory (RAM)) slower than accessing a cache? — a cache is part of the CPU, but data needs to travel across a bus to move between the CPU and main memory; the memory circuits used in RAM are slower than the memory circuits used in a cache

## Reducing memory accesses
* Q5: _Cross-out unnecessary loads and stores for the following assembly code:_
    ```
    000000000000076c <divide>:                      
        76c:    d10083ff     sub    sp, sp, #0x20   
        770:    b9000fe0     str    w0, [sp, #12]
        774:    b9000be1     str    w1, [sp, #8]        XXXX

        784:    b9400be0     ldr    w0, [sp, #12]
        788:    1ac00c20     sdiv   w0, w1, w0      
        78c:    b9001fe0     str    w0, [sp, #28]       XXXX
        790:    b9401fe0     ldr    w0, [sp, #28]       XXXX
        794:    910083ff     add    sp, sp, #0x20   
        798:    d65f03c0     ret                    
    ```
* Q6: _Cross-out unnecessary loads and stores for the following assembly code:_
    ```
    000000000000071c <flip>:
        71c:    d10083ff     sub    sp, sp, #0x20
        720:    b9000fe0     str    w0, [sp, #12]   XXXX

        730:    7100001f     cmp    w0, #0x0
        734:    54000081     b.eq   740 <flip+0x28>
        738:    b9001fff     str    wzr, [sp, #28]
        73c:    14000002     b      748 <flip+0x2c>

        748:    b9401fe0     ldr    w0, [sp, #28]
        74c:    910083ff     add    sp, sp, #0x20
        750:    d65f03c0     ret    
    ```

## Locality
* Q7: _For each of the following scenarios, indicate whether it is an example of temporal locality, spatial locality, or neither._
    * Gates for flights on the same airline are located in the same airport terminal/concourse – spatial locality
    * A grocery list is arranged in alphabetical order – neither
    * Clothes in a closet are grouped into outfits, with a sweater, a shirt, and a pair of pants stored next to each other – spatial locality
    * Boxes of cereal, bowls, and spoons are stored in adjacent kitchen cabinets/drawers – spatial locality
    * You repeatedly check your phone for new messages – temporal locality
    * A variable used in a for loop – temporal locality
    * Variables used in different functions – neither
    * A function's parameters, which are each used once within the function – spatial locality

## Caching
* Q8: _Assume the cache size is 3 and the **optimal** cache replacement algorithm is used. Indicate what happens with the cache on each data access._
    * Access 2 — +2
    * Access 4 — +4
    * Access 1 — +1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 3 — -1/+3
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — -3/+1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — Hit
* Q9: _Assume the cache size is 3 and the **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used. Indicate what happens with the cache on each data access._
    * Access 2 — +2
    * Access 4 — +4
    * Access 1 — +1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 3 — -1/+3
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — -3/+1
    * Access 2 — Hit
    * Access 4 — Hit
    * Access 1 — Hit

## Loop optimization
* Q10: _Modify the following code to perform all relevant loop optimizations. You should assume the length of the key is **significantly smaller** than the length of the plain string, such that the entire key will fit in the cache but the entire plain string will not fit in the cache._
    ```C
    char *vigenere(char *plain, char *key, int keylen) {
        char *cipher = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(plain) + 1));
        cipher[strlen(plain)] = '\0';
        int j = 0;
        while (j < keylen) {
            int i = j;
            while (i < strlen(plain)) {
                cipher[i] = (((plain[i] - 'A') + key[j]) % 26) + 'A';
                i += keylen;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return cipher;
    }
    ```
    Optimizations: loop-invariant code motion to call `strlen` only once; loop interchange to avoid "jumping around" the `plain` array (there is now "jumping around" the key array, but this is tolerable because the key is small enough to fit entirely in the cache)
    ```C
    char *vigenere(char *plain, char *key, int keylen) {
        int len = strlen(plain);
        char *cipher = malloc(sizeof(char) * (len + 1));
        cipher[len] = '\0';
        int i = 0;
        while (i < len) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < keylen && i < len) {
                cipher[i] = (((plain[i] - 'A') + key[j]) % 26) + 'A';
                j++;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return cipher;
    }
    ```
    Alternative code with same optimizations
    ```C
    char *vigenere(char *plain, char *key, int keylen) {
        int len = strlen(plain);
        char *cipher = malloc(sizeof(char) * (len + 1));
        cipher[len] = '\0';
        int i = 0;
        while (i < len) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < keylen && i+j < len) {
                cipher[i+j] = (((plain[i+j] - 'A') + key[j]) % 26) + 'A';
                j++;
            }
            i += keylen;
        }
        return cipher;
    }
    ```

## Processes
* Q11: _Write a program that creates a new process. The child process should print "I am a child"; the parent process should print "I am a parent; my child is CPID" (replacing CPID with the child’s PID)._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("I am a child\n");
        }
        else {
            printf("I am a parent; my child is %d\n", pid);
        }
    }
    ```
* Q12: _Will the output produced by your program always appear in a particular order? Why or why not?_
    * No, because the parent does not `wait` for the child to finish before printing, and the OS scheduler determines which order the processes run
    * If you included a call to `wait` before the call to `printf` in the else body, then the answer would be yes, because the parent waits for the child to finish before printing
* Q13: _Write a program that creates two new processes. The first process should run the executable `/usr/bin/whoami`. The second process should print `I have a sibling` after the first process has finished._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int retval = fork();
        if (retval == 0) {
            char *cmd[] = { "/usr/bin/whoami", NULL };
            execv(cmd[0], cmd);
        } else {
            wait(NULL); 
        }

        retval = fork();
        if (retval == 0) {
            printf("I have a sibling\n");
            return 0;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    ```
* Q14: _What are all possible outputs the following program may produce?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        printf("A\n");
        int retval = fork();
        printf("B\n");
        if (retval == 0) {
            printf("C\n");
        }
        else {
            printf("D\n");
        }
    }
