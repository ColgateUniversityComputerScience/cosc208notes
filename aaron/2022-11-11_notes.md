## Warm-up
* Q1: _What does the following code output?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        int retval = fork();
        if (retval == 0) {
            y -= 5;
        } else {
            y+= 5;
        }
        printf("x=%d y=%d\n", x, y);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    x=10 y=25
    x=10 y=15
    ```
    OR
    ```
    x=10 y=15
    x=10 y=25
    ```

## Waiting for processes
* Wait for any child to finish — `int wait(int *status)`
    * Returns PID of the child process that finished
    * `status` parameter is optional
        * if passed a valid integer pointer, `wait` will store the return value of the child process's `main` function at the referenced memory location
        * if return value of child process's main function is not needed, then pass `NULL`
* Wait for a specific process to finish — `int waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options)`
    * Returns PID of the process that finished
    * `pid` is PID if process to wait for — need not be a child process
    * `status` is the same as `wait`
    * `options` is typically `0`, except in special circumstances
* Wait functions do not return until child or specific process, respectively, finishes
* Q2: _What are all possible outputs of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child\n");
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("Parent\n");
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Child
    Parent
    ```
* Q3: _What are all possible outputs of this program (assuming the new process has PID 13346)?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int pid = fork();
        printf("A %d\n", pid);
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("B\n");
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("C\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    ```
    A 0
    A 13346
    B
    C
    ```
    OR
    ```
    A 13346
    A 0
    B
    C
    ```
    OR
    ```
    A 0
    B
    A 13346
    C
    ```

## Running a different program
* `int exec(const char *path, const char *argv[])`
    * Used to switch which program is running in a process — replaces current code with code for a new program and starts executing that program from main
    * `path` == full path to program
    * `argv` == array of strings containing the full path to the program, any command line arguments, and `NULL`
* Example program
    ```C
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("Begin\n");
        int pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            printf("Child\n");
            char *cmd[] = { "/usr/bin/date", NULL };
            execv(cmd[0], cmd);
        } else {
            printf("Parent\n");
        }
        printf("End\n");
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```
    Begin
    Parent
    End 
    Child

    ```

* Q4: _What is the output produced by running `./progA`, assuming no errors occur?_
    **progA:**
    ```C
    int main() {
        pid_t a = fork();
        if (a == 0) {
            char *cmd[] = { "./progB", NULL };
            execv(cmd[0], cmd);
            printf("A 2nd gen\n");
            return 0;
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("A 1st gen\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    ```
    **progB:**
    ```C
    int main() {
        pid_t b = fork();
        if (b == 0) {
            printf("B 2nd gen\n");
            return 0;
        } else {
            wait(NULL);
            printf("B 1st gen\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    ```
    ```
    B 2nd gen
    B 1st gen
    A 1st gen
    ```

## Scheduling processes
* OS decides which process to run and for how long
* _What factors should the OS consider when making these decisions?_
    * Time for process to complete
    * Overhead of context switching
    * Fairness
    * User interaction
* For now, consider one of these metrics: turnaround time
    * T<sub>turnaround</sub> = T<sub>complete</sub> - T<sub>arrive</sub>
* For now, assume a process starts and runs to completion—i.e., no I/O and no preemption
