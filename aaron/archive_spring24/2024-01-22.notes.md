## Announcements
* Before class on Wednesday:
    * Complete "Getting to know you" questionnaire
    * Review the syllabus
    * Read Dive Into Systems 16.0-16.2.1, 16.3.1 and answer pre-class questions
* First lab next week

## Outline
* Getting to know each other
* What is a computer system?
* Syllabus highlights

## Getting to know Aaron
* My name is...Aaron Gember-Jacobson
* Please call me...Aaron
* My pronouns are...he/him
* Something I did over winter break that I enjoyed was...building with Legos.
* Something I want you to know about my life at Colgate is...I strive to create equitable and inclusive learning environments, because I want to counteract systems of power and privilege within the field of computer science and within Colgate.
* Something I want you to know about my life outside of Colgate is...I live in Hamilton with my wife (Emily), kids (Henry, 8; Molly, 6), and cats (Hairy and Luna).

## What is a computer system?
* _What do you think of when you hear the term "computer systems"?_
* Main components of a computer system
    * Central processing unit (CPU) — executes assembly instructions
    * Random access memory (RAM) — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage devices (e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive stores) – persistently stores program data (code, documents, etc.)
    * Input/output (I/O) ports – receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
    * Operating system (OS) — manages hardware resources
* Why is it important to learn about computer systems?
    * To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism
* Course topics – see the standards in the _Quizzes_ section of the syllabus
    * Data representation
    * Program memory
    * Architecture
    * Assembly
    * Storage
    * Operating Systems & Concurrency

## Syllabus highlights
* Important dates
* Preparing for class: read textbook sections and answer pre-class questions on Moodle
    * Use the pre-class questions to guide your reading; research shows that you remember/understand things better if you have to answer questions about it 
    * For Wednesday: Read Dive Into Systems 16.0-16.2.1, 16.3.1 and answer pre-class questions
* Quizzes and projects: demonstrate that you undertand and can apply the concepts covered in the course
    * Quizzes every two weeks on Wednesdays, starting February 14
    * First of three projects will be released in early February and due February 21
* Academic integrity: 
    * Do not share or copy code from other students
    * Indicate if code is copied from an external source
    * I want you to succeed; I will be reasonably flexible on deadlines
* Alternative grading:
    * Designed to be equitable and encourage learning and growth
    * Constructive feedback coupled with opportunities to revise and reattempt work without penalty – e.g., every standard will appear on at least three quizzes and you need to acheive satisfactory performance twice; every project can be revised to improve its functionality and design
    * Course grade is based on the extent to which your work on quizzes and projects is satisfactory 
* Seek help and support!
