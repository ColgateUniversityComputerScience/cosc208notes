* Threads
* Processes
* Caching
* Memory hierarchy
* Pointers & dynamic memory allocation

## Warm-up (Q4-Q7 from last class)

_For each of the following service providers, indicate what type of service they offer._

* Q1: _Box provides secure file sharing and storage_

    Storage-as-a-Service (STaaS)

* Q2: _Microsoft Azure provides virtual machines running Windows or Linux_

    Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

* Q3: _Heroku allows tenants to deploy code written in Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, or Clojure_

    Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

* Q4: _Oracle Supply Chain Management (SCM) is software that allows businesses to manage their supply chain_

    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

## Virtual machines and containers

* Q5: _What is an advantage of using **virtual machines with a type 1 hypervisor** instead of **virtual machines with a type 2 hypervisor**?_

    With a type 1 hypervisor, system calls issued by processes only need to be handled by the hypervisor and guest operating system, whereas with a type 2 hypervisor, system calls issued by processes need to be handled by the host operating system, hypervisor, and guest operating system. Thus, a type 1 hypervisor adds less overhead and results in better performance.

* Q6: _What is an advantage of using **virtual machines with a type 2 hypervisor** instead of **virtual machines with a type 1 hypervisor**?_

    A type 2 hypervisor can be installed atop an existing (host) operating system just like any other application, whereas a type 1 hypervisor needs to be installed directly atop the hardware before any operating systems are installed. Thus, a type 2 hypervisor is easier to set up.

## Threads

A program contains the following functions:
```C
void *dbl(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t = *t * 2;
}

void *inc(void *arg) {
    int *t = (int *)arg;
    *t = *t + 1;
}
```
_For each of the following main methods, list **all possible outputs** the program could produce. Assume threads are only preempted if they become blocked waiting for other threads._


```c
// Q7
int main() {
    int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *total = 3;
    pthread_t thrA, thrB;
    pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &dbl, total);
    pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &inc, total);
    pthread_join(thrA, NULL);
    pthread_join(thrB, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", total);
}
```

* `7` (if `thrB` runs after `thrA` finishes)
* `8` (if `thrA` runs after `thrB` finishes)


```c
// Q8
int main() {
    int *total = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *total = 3
    pthread_t thrA, thrB;
    pthread_create(&thrA, NULL, &inc, total);
    pthread_join(thrA, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thrB, NULL, &dbl, total);
    pthread_join(thrB, NULL);
    printf("%d\n", total);
}
```

* `8` (`thrA` is joined, i.e., must finish, before `thrB` is created) 

* Q9: _The following partially written program takes an integer (`len`) and a string (`word`) as command-line arguments and creates a thread that calls the `trim` function. Finish writing the code such that the `trim` function returns the first `len` characters of `word`, and the main function prints the returned string after the thread completes._


```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct trim_args {
    int len;
    char *word;
};

void *trim(void *arg) {
    struct trim_args *targs = (struct trim_args *)arg;
    char *result = malloc(sizeof(char) * (targs->len + 1));
    for (int i = 0; i < targs->len; i++) {
        result[i] = targs->word[i];
    }
    result[targs->len] = '\0';
    return result;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Dummy command-line arguments
    argc = 3;
    argv = malloc(sizeof(char *) * 3);
    argv[1] = "3";
    argv[2] = "December";
    
    if (argc != 3) {
        printf("Provide an integer and a word\n");
        return 1;
    }
    int len = atoi(argv[1]);
    char *word = argv[2];
    
    struct trim_args targs = {len, word};
    
    pthread_t thr;
    pthread_create(&thr, NULL, &trim, &targs);
    
    char *result = NULL;
    pthread_join(thr, (void**) &result);
    printf("%s\n", result);
}
```

### Processes

* Q10: _Write a program that creates a new process. The child process should print "I am a child"; the parent process should print "I am a parent; my child is CPID" (replacing CPID with the child’s PID)._


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("I am a child\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("I am a parent; my child is %d\n", pid);
    }
}
```

    I am a parent; my child is 1375
    I am a child


* Q11: _Will the output produced by your program always appear in a particular order? Why or why not?_

* No, because the parent does not `wait` for the child to finish before printing, and the OS scheduler determines which order the processes run
* If you included a call to `wait` before the call to `printf` in the else body, then the answer would be yes, because the parent waits for the child to finish before printing

* Q12: _What are all possible outputs the following program may produce?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
    printf("A\n");
    int retval = fork();
    printf("B\n");
    if (retval == 0) {
        printf("C\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("D\n");
    }
}
```

```
A
B
C
B
D
```
OR
```
A
B
B
C
D
```
OR
```
A
B
D
B
C
```
OR
```
A
B
B
D
C
```

* Q13: _Write a program that creates a new process which runs `/bin/sleep 10`. The parent process should send the `SIGKILL` signal to the new process and exit._


```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
int main() {
    int retval = fork();
    if (retval < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    else if (retval == 0) {
        char *cmd[] = { "/bin/sleep", "10", NULL };
        execv(cmd[0], cmd);
        printf("Failed to execute /bin/sleep\n");
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        kill(retval, SIGKILL);
        return 0;
    }
}
```

* Q14: _Write a program that prints `"beep"` whenever it receives the `SIGALRM` signal._


```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handler(int signum) {
    printf("beep\n");
}

int main() {
    if (signal(SIGALRM, &handler) == SIG_ERR) {
        printf("Failed to register signal handler\n");
        return 1;
    }
}
```

## Memory hierarchy

* Q17: _What is the **fastest volatile** memory?_

    registers

* Q18: _What is the **fastest non-volatile** memory?_

    solid state drive (SSD) or SDcard

* Q19: _Why is a hard disk drive (HDD) slower than a solid state drive (SSD)?_

an HDD has moving parts that need to be moved into position before data can be read/written    solid state drive (SSD) or SDcard

* Q20: _Why is accessing main memory (i.e., Random Access Memory (RAM)) slower than accessing a cache?_

a cache is part of the CPU, but data needs to travel across a bus to move between the CPU and main memory; the memory circuits used in RAM are slower than the memory circuits used in a cache

## Memory errors

The intended behavior of the program below is to output a string that contains multiple copies of a word (e.g., `"byebye"`). The code below compiles without warnings, but it contains multiple errors.


```c
/*1 */  #include <stdlib.h>
/*2 */  #include <string.h>
/*3 */  #include <stdio.h>
/*4 */  char *repeat(char *word, int count) {
/*5 */      char *dup = malloc(sizeof(*word) * count + 1);
/*6 */      int k = 0;
/*7 */      for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
/*8 */          for (int j = 0; j <= strlen(word) * count; j++) {
/*9 */              dup[k] = word[j];
/*10*/              k++;
/*11*/          }
/*12*/      }
/*13*/      free(dup);
/*14*/      return dup;
/*15*/  }
/*16*/  int main() {
/*17*/      char *orig = malloc(4);
/*18*/      strcpy(orig, "bye");
/*19*/      char *result = repeat(orig, 2);
/*20*/      printf("%s\n", result);
/*21*/  }
```

_For each of the following errors produced by valgrind, describe (in 2-3 sentences) **why** the error is occurring and **how** you would modify the code to correct the error._

* Q21:
    ```
    Invalid write of size 1
        at 0x4006CA: repeat (repeat.c:9)
        by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
    Address 0x5204093 is 0 bytes after a block of size 3 alloc'd
        at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
        by 0x40066B: repeat (repeat.c:5)
        by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
    ```

Not enough space was allocated for the duplicated string: `sizeof(*word)` gets the size of a single character. Use `strlen(word)` to get the number of characters in the original word.

* Q22:
    ```
    Invalid read of size 1
        at 0x4006BF: repeat (repeat.c:9)
        by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
    Address 0x5204044 is 0 bytes after a block of size 4 alloc'd
        at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
        by 0x400723: main (repeat.c:17)
    ```

The inner for loop goes beyond the end of the original word. The for loop condition should be `j < strlen(word)`.

* Q23:
    ```
    Invalid read of size 1
        at 0x4E88CD0: vfprintf (vfprintf.c:1632)
        by 0x4E8F8A8: printf (printf.c:33)
        by 0x40076B: main (repeat.c:20)
    Address 0x5204090 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 3 free'd
        at 0x4C2EDEB: free (in vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
        by 0x4006FF: repeat (repeat.c:13)
        by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
    Block was alloc'd at
        at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
        by 0x40066B: repeat (repeat.c:5)
        by 0x400752: main (repeat.c:19)
    ```

The string containing the repeated word is free'd (in `repeat`) before it is printed (in `main`). Move the call to `free` in `repeat` to after the call to `printf` in `main`.

* Q24:
    ```
    4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
        at 0x4C2DB8F: malloc (in vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
        by 0x400723: main (repeat.c:17)
    ```

The space for the original word (allocated in `main`) is not freed. Add `free(orig)` after the call to `repeat` in `main`.

## Pointers & dynamic memory allocation

* Q25: _Assume the following program is executed._


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
void magic(char *x, char **y) {
    char *z = *y;
    z[2] = 'a';
    *x = 'k';
    *y = &x[1];
    // STOP HERE
}

int main() {
    char *season = malloc(sizeof(char) * 7);
    strcpy(season, "winter");
    char precip[6] = "snow";
    char *ptr = season + 3;
    magic(precip, &ptr);
}
```

_Draw the contents of the stack and heap when the program reaches the comment `STOP HERE`. If a memory region is freed, cross it out; do not erase it from your diagram._
