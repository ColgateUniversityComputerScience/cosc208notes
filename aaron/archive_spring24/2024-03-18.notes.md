## Outline
* Warm-up
* Assembly

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has two general purpose registers (r0 and r1) and supports four bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`). Assume you already have storage, MUX, DMUX, and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) circuits available as building blocks._

## Assembly instructions

* Simple instructions a processor can execute – e.g., add two integers, compare two integers, load/store a value from/to main memory
* C code is compiled into assembly code
    * Python code is interpreted; interpreter is compiled into assembly
    * Java code is compiled to Java byte code, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM); JVM is compiled into assembly
* Assembly instructions are expressed in binary
    * Some bits determine the operation – used as select bits for the multiplexer between the arithmetic and logic circuits and the ALU's output
    * Some bits determine the first source register and other bits determine the second source register – used as select bits for the multiplexers between the register file's outputs and ALU's inputs
    * Some bits determine the destination register – used as select bits for the demultiplexer between the ALU's output and register file's input
* E.g., our simple processor from the warm-up uses 5-bit assembly instructions
    * First (i.e., left-most) two bits determine operation
    * Next bit determines destination register
    * Next bit determines first source register
    * Final (i.e., right-most) bit determinse second source register
* Instruction set architectures (ISAs) — defines the low-level instructions a central processing unit (CPU), or processor, can execute
    * Most popular Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architecture: x86 (includes IA32 and x86-64)
    * Most popular Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture: ARM
    * Other common RISC architectures: SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture), MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages), PowerPC, ARC (Argonaut RISC Core)
* Our goal: to understand the relationship between C code and its corresponding assembly code to make informed programming decisions

## Extra practice

* Q2: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has four general purpose registers (r0-r3) and supports four operations:_
    * `nop`: no operation; do nothing
    * `mov`: copy a value from one register to another
    * `movc`: store a constant value into a register, where the constant comes from the last four bits of the instruction
    * `add`: add the values in two registers and store the result in a register
