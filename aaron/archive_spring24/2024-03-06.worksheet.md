## Warm-up

* Q1: _Create a 1-bit circuit for `A <= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## n-bit Logical Circuits

* Q2: _Complete the truth-table for `A > B` when A and B are two bits_

| A1 A0 | B1 B0 | A > B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   0 | 0   0 |   0   |
| 0   1 | 0   0 |   1   |
| 1   0 | 0   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   1 |       |

## Extra practice

* Q3: _Draw a 1-bit circuit for `A < B` using only `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates. Show your work (i.e., any intermediate design steps you took)._
