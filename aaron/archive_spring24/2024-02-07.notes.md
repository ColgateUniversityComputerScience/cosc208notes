* Binary arithmetic
* Overflow

## Warm-up

* Q1: _What is the largest magnitude negative number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    -16

* Q2: _What is the smallest magnitude negative number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    -1

* Q3: _What is the largest magnitude positive number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    15

* _What happens if you attempt to assign a constant value that is too large to represent using the number of available bits?_ – e.g.,


```c
// Example 2
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    unsigned char c = 300;
    printf("%u\n", c);
}
```

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/tmph0fix2tx.c:3:23: warning: implicit conversion from 'int' to 'unsigned char' changes value from 300 to 44 [-Wconstant-conversion]
        unsigned char c = 300;
                      ~   ^~~
    1 warning generated.


    44


* However, if you assign a variable whose value is too large to represent using the number of available bits, then the value is truncated but **no warning is generated** – e.g.,


```c
// Example 3
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    unsigned int i = 300;
    unsigned char c = i;
    printf("%u\n", c);
}
```

    44


* Takeaway: carefully consider the range of values a variable can accommodate, because C will let you do things that are dangerous

## Binary arithmetic

* Addition: same as decimal, except you carry a one instead of a ten
* Example: 5 + 5

```
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------

      1
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
       0

     01
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
      10

    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
     010

    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
  0b1010
```

* Check our work:

```
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10 = 5+5
```

* Another example: 5 + -5

```
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------

      1
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
       0

     11
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
      00

    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
     000

    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
    0000
(Carry-out => 1)
```

* Subtraction: add the negation

_Express the decimal numbers in 8-bit two's complement, then use bitwise arithmetic:_
* Q4: `10 + 5`

    0b00001010 + 0b00000101 = 0b00001111

* Q5: `0b00000111 + 15`

    0b00000111 + 0b00001111 = 0b00010110

* Q6: `-10 + 0b00000101`

    (0b11110101 + 0b1) + 0b00000101 = 0b11110110 + 0b00000101 = 0b11111011

* Q7: `0b00001010 - 5`

    0b00001010 + (0b11111010 + 0b1) = 0b00001010 + 0b11111011 = 0b00000101

* Q8: `64 + 64`

    0b01000000 + 0b1000000 = 0b10000000

* Q9: `0b00100000 + 0b01100000`

    0b10000000 = -128 (overflow occurred)

## Overflow

* 32 + 96 = -128!? What!?
* Computation overflowed — i.e., result is too large to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to negative numbers
    * Can only occur when you add two positive numbers
* Computation can also underflow — i.e., result is too small to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to positive numbers
    * E.g., -64 + -65 = `0b11000000` + `0b10111111` = `0b01111111` = 127
    * Can only occur when you add two negative numbers
* Overflow and underflow are impossible when adding a positive number and a negative number
    * Assume you add the largest magnitude positive number and the smallest magnitude negative number (-1); the result will be slightly less magnitude than the positive operand, and thus cannot overflow
    * Assume you add the smallest magnitude positive number (1) and the largest magnitude negative number; the result will be slightly less magnitude than the negative operand, and thus cannot underflow
* _What happens if you overflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to zero, and get a smaller positive integer
* _What happens if you underflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to the maximum value, and get a larger positive integer

_For each of the following computations, determine whether the computation overflows, underflows, or neither. Assume we are using 8-bit signed integers._

_Postponed to next class_

## Extra practice
* Q15: _Write a function called `sign` that takes a number expressed in binary using two's complement and returns `-1` if the number is negative, `0` if the number is zero, or `1` if the number is positive. The binary is stored as a character array that starts with `0b` and contains an arbitrary number of `'0'` and `'1'` characters._


```c
#include <string.h>
int sign(char binary[]) {
    if (binary[2] == '1') {
        return -1;
    } else {
        for (int i = 3; i < strlen(binary); i++) {
            if (binary[i] == '1') {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
// Testing
#include <assert.h>
int main() {
    assert(sign("0b0100") == 1);
    assert(sign("0b1000") == -1);
    assert(sign("0b0000") == 0);
}
```

_Perform the following conversions_
* Q16: `97` to 8-bit unsigned binary

    0b01100001

* Q17: `0b11001100` to unsigned decimal

    128 + 64 + 8 + 4 = 204

* Q18: `0b11001100` to signed decimal

    -52

* Q19: `0x27` to unsigned decimal

    39

* Q20: `0xDEAD` to 16-bit binary

    0b1101111010101101

_Perform the following computations with 8-bit signed integers._
* Q21: `0b10100011 + 7`

    0b10100011 + 0b00000111 = 0b10101010 = -86

* Q22: `48 - 0b01100001`

    0b00110000 + 0b10011111 = 0b11001111 = -49
