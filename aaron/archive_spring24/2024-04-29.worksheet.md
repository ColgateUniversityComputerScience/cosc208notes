## Announcements
* Attend VAP candidate talk tomorrow 11:30am-12:00pm
* Project 3 revisions due Friday @ 5pm
* Quiz 6 Wednesday â€“Â can start as early as 8:05am
    * 6.1: Describe the mechanisms operating systems use to allocate hardware resources and ensure errant processes do not take over the system
    * 6.2: Determine the possible outputs of C programs that involve multiple processes and/or threads
    * 6.3: Develop C programs that create and wait for processes and execute other programs
    * 6.4: Modify C programs to use threads
    * 6.5: Compare virtualization technologies
    * 5.1: Determine where code and data resides throughout a programâ€™s lifecycle
    * 5.2: Determine how assembly and/or C code can be modified for more efficient use of storage
    * Optional:
        * 4.1: Interpret ARM assembly code
        * 4.2: Determine the relationship between C code and ARM assembly code

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Loop interchange
* Virtual machines
* Hypervisors

## Warm-up (Q3 from last class)

* Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 
```
3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4
```
* Q1: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when an **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time take a few deep breaths to reduce stress.

## Loop interchange

* Example


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define LEN 12
int main() {
    int *array = malloc(sizeof(int) * LEN);

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i++) {
        array[i] = i;
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < LEN; k += 4) {
            sum += array[j+k];
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
}
```

* Q2: _Would loop interchange improve the efficiency of this code?_


```c
void hundreds() {
    int *nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * 1000);
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i+= 100) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
            nums[i+j] = i;
        }
    }
}
```

* Q3: _Would loop interchange improve the efficiency of this code?_


```c
void multiplication(int grid[][], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            grid[r][c] = c * r;
        }
    }
}
```
