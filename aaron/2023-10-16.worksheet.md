# Assembly: operations and operands; mapping assembly to C
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-10-16_

## Announcements
* Project 1 feedback in `report.txt` file in git repositoryÂ â€“ use this feedback to improve your code for project 2
* Project 2 due Thursday @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Viewing assembly code
* Operands
* Mapping assembly to C

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has two general purpose registers (r0 and r1) and supports four bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`). Assume you already have storage, MUX, DMUX, and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) circuits available as building blocks._

<p style="height:25em;"></p>

* Q2: _For this processor's assembly language, how many bits are required for the operation code?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q3: _For this processor's assembly language, how many bits are required for a complete instruction?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q4: _What is the binary representation of the assembly instruction for `r0 = r0 ^ r1`?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Viewing assembly code

* Goal is to understand the relationship between C code and its corresponding assembly code to make informed programming decisions

* Example program (`dogyears.c`)


```c
/* 1*/   #include <stdio.h>
/* 2*/   #include <stdlib.h>
/* 3*/   int dog_years(int birth) {
/* 4*/       int current = 2023;
/* 5*/       int years = current - birth;
/* 6*/       years = years * 7;
/* 7*/       return years;
/* 8*/   }
/* 9*/   int main() {
/*10*/       printf("What year were you born? ");
/*11*/       char year[5];
/*12*/       fgets(year, 5, stdin);
/*13*/       int dog_age = dog_years(atoi(year));
/*14*/       printf("You are %d dog years old\n", dog_age);
/*15*/   }
```

## Mapping assembly code to C code

* Q5: _For each line of assembly, indicate which original line of C code the assembly instruction was derived from._


```c
/* 1*/  #include <stdio.h>
/* 2*/  int years_to_double(int rate) {
/* 3*/      int ruleof72 = 72;
/* 4*/      int years = ruleof72 / rate;
/* 5*/      return years;
/* 6*/  }
/* 7*/  int main() {
/* 8*/      int r = 10;
/* 9*/      int y = years_to_double(r);
/*10*/      printf("With an interest rate of %d%% it 
                   will take ~%d years to double your money\n", r, y);
/*11*/  }
```

```
000000000000076c <years_to_double>:
    76c:	d10083ff 	sub  sp, sp, #0x20
    770:	b9000fe0 	str  w0, [sp, #12]
    774:	52800900 	mov  w0, #0x48
    778:	b9001be0 	str  w0, [sp, #24]
    77c:	b9401be1 	ldr  w1, [sp, #24]
    780:	b9400fe0 	ldr  w0, [sp, #12]
    784:	1ac00c20 	sdiv w0, w1, w0
    788:	b9001fe0 	str  w0, [sp, #28]
    78c:	b9401fe0 	ldr  w0, [sp, #28]
    790:	910083ff 	add  sp, sp, #0x20
    794:	d65f03c0 	ret
```

## Extra practice

* Q6: _If the processing unit you created in the warm-up is fed the instruction `0b11110` what will the processing unit do?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q7: _If the processing unit you created in the warm-up is fed the instruction `0b11111` what will the processing unit do?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q8: _If the processing unit you created in the warm-up contained 16 registers instead of 2, how many bits would be required for a complete assembly instruction?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q9: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has four general purpose registers (r0-r3) and supports four operations:_
    * `nop`: no operation; do nothing
    * `mov`: copy a value from one register to another
    * `movc`: store a constant value into a register, where the constant comes from the last four bits of the instruction
    * `add`: add the values in two registers and store the result in a register
