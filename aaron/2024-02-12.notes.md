## Warm-up (Q6-Q12 from last class)

_Determine the resulting binary_

* Q1: `0b1010 | 0b0101`

    0b1111

* Q2: `0b1010 & 0b0101`

    0b0000

* Q3: `~(0b1100 & 0b0110)`

    ~0b0100 = 0b1011

* Q4: `0b1000 >> 0b011`

    0b0001 (divide by 2^3)

* Q5: `0b0001 << 0b0010`

    0b0100 (multiply by 2^2)

* Q6: `0b1111 & (~0b0010)`

    0b1111 & 0b1101 = 0b1101 (clear a bit)

* Q7: `0b0000 | 0b0010`

    0b0010 (set a bit)

## Real numbers

* Real numbers may have fractional parts -- e.g., `3.14`
* _How can we encode real numbers?_
* Fixed-point representation
    * Location of decimal point is fixed — some bits encode whole numbers, and some bits encode fractional numbers
    * Example: 8-bit fixed point with 3 bits for the fractional part: `0b01011010` = 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^-1 + 1 * 2^-2 + 0 * 2^-3 = 8 + 2 + 1 + 0.25 = 11.25
    * _What is an advantage of fixed-point representation?_
        * Easy to compute
    * _What is a disadvantage of fixed-point representation?_ 
        * Range of real numbers is fixed — cannot represent large whole numbers or small fractional numbers
* Float-point representation
    * Uses a "scaling factor" to multiply (or divide) fractional part
    * Bits in the significand represent (from left to right) 2^-1, 2^-2, ... 2^-23
    * Bits in the exponent represent an unsigned integer 0 - 255
    * Multiply significand by 2^(exponent - 127) to get final result
    * Can represent large whole numbers **or** small fractional numbers, but not a large whole number with a small fractional part

## Pointers

* A special type of variable that holds a memory address
    * A pointer "points to" a location in memory
* Declaration consists of:
    * Type of value stored in memory at the address stored in the pointer variable
    * Asterisk (`*`)
    * Name of pointer variable
    * Example: `int *p` — declares a pointer variable `p` that refers to a memory location where an integer is stored
* Can be used to indirectly read and write another variable
* Address-of (`&`) operator obtains the memory address where a variable is stored
* De-reference (*) operator is used to refer to the value stored at the memory address contained in the pointer variable

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i = 42;
    int *p = &i; // p now contains the address where the 
                 //     value of variable i is stored
                 // p “points-to” i
    printf("%p\n", p);
    printf("%d\n", *p); // Outputs 42, because p contains the memory address 
                       //     where i is stored (i.e., p points-to i), and the 
                       //     variable i currently contains the value 42
    *p = *p + 1; // Updates the value in variable i to 43, because p 
                 //     contains the memory address where i is stored 
                 //     (i.e., p points-to i)
    printf("%d %d\n", i, *p);
}
```

* _What happens if we assign a value to the pointer variable without dereferencing the pointer?_ — we update the memory address stored in the pointer variable; we point to a new location in memory

* Q8: _What does the following program output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    int *x = &a;
    int *y = &b;
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", a, b, *x, *y);
    a = 5;
    *y = 7;
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", a, b, *x, *y);
    *x = *x + 4;
    b = b + 3;
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", a, b, *x, *y);
    x = y;
    printf("%d %d %d %d\n", a, b, *x, *y);
}
```

* Q9: _Write a program that:_
    1. _Stores the character 'A' in a variable_
    2. _Creates and uses a pointer to print the character_
    3. _Uses the same pointer to change the character to 'B'_
    4. _Uses the same pointer to advance the character by 3 (to 'E')_
    5. _Creates and uses a second pointer to print the character_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char ch = 'A';
    char *ptr = &ch;
    printf("%c\n", *ptr);
    *ptr = 'B';
    *ptr = *ptr + 3;
    char *ptr2 = ptr;
    printf("%c\n", *ptr2);
}
```

## Pointers as parameters

* Functions can take pointers as parameters
    * Similar to a pointer declaration, include an asterisk before the parameter name: e.g., `void foo(int *a)`
    * Function gets a copy of the memory address stored in the pointer variable, not a copy of the value stored at that memory address

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
void value(int a) {
    a = 2;
}
void pointer(int *b) {
    *b = 3;
}
int main() {
    int v = 1;
    int *p = &v;
    value(v);
    printf("%d\n", v);
    pointer(p);
    printf("%d\n", v);
}
```

## Extra practice

_Apply the following bitwise operations_

* Q10: `0b0011 & 0b0101`

    0b0001

* Q11: `0b0011 | 0b0101`

    0b0111

* Q12: `0b0011 ^ 0b0101`

    0b0110

_For each of the following expressions, select all operators that make the expression evaluate to true. Operands are encoded using two's complement._

* Q13: `0b110000 __ 0b111111`  
```
&   &&   |   ||   ^   <
```

`&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `^`, `<`

* Q14: `0b011110 __ 0b000001`

```

`&&`, `|`, `||`, `^`

* Q15: `0b000000 __ 0b000000`  
```
&   &&   |   ||   ^   <
```

_none_

* Q16: `0b000111 __ 0b000111`

_Express the following real numbers using 8-bit fixed point representation with 4 bits for the fractional part. If the number cannot be expressed exactly, express it as closely as you can and indicate which number is actually represented by the bits._
* Q17: `5.75`

    0b01011100 = 2^2 + 2^0 + 2^-1 + 2^-2

* Q18: `16.125`

    0b11110010 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 + 2^-3 = 15.125

* Q19: `4.1875`

    0b01000011 = 2^2 + 2^0 + 2^-3 + 2^-4 = 4.1875
