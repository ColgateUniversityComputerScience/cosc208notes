# Hello, C: defining functions; using libraries; stack frames
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2024-01-26_

## Announcements
* Before next class: read _Dive Into Systems_ 16.5 and answer pre-class questions

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Defining functions
* Using libraries
* Stack frames

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Write a program that prints out the powers of 2 from 2 through 2048._

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the warm-up; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Defining functions

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int result = add(1,2);
    printf("%d\n", result);
}
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x+y;
}
```

* Q2: _In the biological process of cell division, each cell divides into two cells and the process repeats. Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Q3: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have at least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._

<div style="height:20em;"></div>

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Program stack

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int multiply(int z) {
    return z * 5 / 9;
}
int subtract(int x, int y) {
    return x - y;
}
int convert(int t) {
    int u = subtract(t, 32);
    int v = multiply(u);
    return v;
}
int main() {
    int f = 68;
    int c = convert(68);
    printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
}
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int copy(int a, int b) {
    a = b;
    return a;
}
int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 7;
    int z = copy(x, y);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
}
```

## Extra practice

* Q5: _Write a program that prints the number of days, hours, and minutes in a week._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q6: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q7: _Write a function called `flipcase` that takes a letter and returns the letter in the opposite case. If the character is not a letter, then return the character unchanged._

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Q8: _Write a function called `floorm` that takes two integers and rounds down the first integer to the closest multiple of the second integer._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q9: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int squared(int base) {
    return base * base;
}
int dbl(int num) {
    printf("%d x 2\n", num);
    return num * 2;   
}
int two(int exponent) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
        result = dbl(result);
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    int n = 3;
    int s = squared(3);
    printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
    int t = two(3);
    printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
}
```

<div style="height:10em;"></div>

* Q10: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 5, the program's output would be:_
    ```
    \   /
     \ / 
      X  
     / \ 
    /   \
    ```
