## Announcements
* Project 1 due Thurs, Sept 21 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Binary arithmetic
* Overflow
* Bitwise operators

## Warm-up

* Q1: _What is the largest magnitude negative number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    -16

* Q2: _What is the smallest magnitude negative number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    -1

* Q3: _What is the largest magnitude positive number that can be represented using 5-bit two's complement?_

    15

## Binary arithmetic

* Addition: same as decimal, except you carry a one instead of a ten
* Example: 5 + 5

```
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------

      1
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
       0

     01
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
      10

    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
     010

    101
  0b0101
+ 0b0101
--------
  0b1010
```

* Check our work:

```
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10 = 5+5
```

* Another example: 5 + -5

```
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------

      1
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
       0

     11
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
      00

    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
     000

    111
  0b0101
+ 0b1011
--------
    0000
(Carry-out => 1)
```

* Subtraction: add the negation

_Express the decimal numbers in 8-bit two's complement, then use bitwise arithmetic:_
* Q4: `10 + 5`

    0b00001010 + 0b00000101 = 0b00001111

* Q5: `0b00000111 + 15`

    0b00000111 + 0b00001111 = 0b00010110

* Q6: `-10 + 0b00000101`

    (0b11110101 + 0b1) + 0b00000101 = 0b11110110 + 0b00000101 = 0b11111011

* Q7: `0b00001010 - 5`

    0b00001010 + (0b11111010 + 0b1) = 0b00001010 + 0b11111011 = 0b00000101

* Q8: `64 + 64`

    0b01000000 + 0b1000000 = 0b10000000

* Q9: `0b00100000 + 0b01100000`

    0b10000000 = -128 (overflow occurred)

## Overflow

* 32 + 96 = -128!? What!?
* Computation overflowed — i.e., result is too large to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to negative numbers
    * Can only occur when you add two positive numbers
* Computation can also underflow — i.e., result is too small to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to positive numbers
    * E.g., -64 + -65 = `0b11000000` + `0b10111111` = `0b01111111` = 127
    * Can only occur when you add two negative numbers
* Overflow and underflow are impossible when adding a positive number and a negative number
    * Assume you add the largest magnitude positive number and the smallest magnitude negative number (-1); the result will be slightly less magnitude than the positive operand, and thus cannot overflow
    * Assume you add the smallest magnitude positive number (1) and the largest magnitude negative number; the result will be slightly less magnitude than the negative operand, and thus cannot underflow
* _What happens if you overflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to zero, and get a smaller positive integer
* _What happens if you underflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to the maximum value, and get a larger positive integer

_For each of the following computations, determine whether the computation overflows, underflows, or neither. Assume we are using 8-bit signed integers._
* Q10: `0b10000000 + 0b01111111`

    neither

* Q11: `0b10000001 + 0b01111111`

    neither

* Q12: `0b10000000 + 0b10000001`

    underflow

* Q13: `0b11000000 + 0b11000000`

    neither

* Q14: `0b01111111 + 0b00000001`

    overflow

## Bitwise operators

* Apply an operation to a single bit (not) or a pair of bits (and, or, xor)
* `~` (not)
    * Flips bits: if bit is 0, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `~0b101` = `0b010`
* `&` (and)
    * If both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 & 0b0011` = `0b0001`
    * This is different than logical and (`&&`) which checks whether both operands are non-zero
* `|` (or)
    * If either or both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 | 0b0011` = `0b0111`
    * This is different than logical or (`||`) which checks whether at least one operand is non-zero
* `^` (xor)
    * If either, but not both, bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 ^ 0b0011` = `0b0110`
* `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift)
    * Move bits to the left or the right and append or prepend zeros to keep the same number of bits
    * Example: `0b1111 << 0b0010` = `0b1100`
    * Example: `0b1111 >> 0b0001` = `0b0111`
    * Can use bit shifting to multiply or divide by powers of two

* Q15: `0b1010 | 0b0101`

## Extra practice
* Q22: _Write a function called `sign` that takes a number expressed in binary using two's complement and returns `-1` if the number is negative, `0` if the number is zero, or `1` if the number is positive. The binary is stored as a character array that starts with `0b` and contains an arbitrary number of `'0'` and `'1'` characters._


```c
#include <string.h>
int sign(char binary[]) {
    if (binary[2] == '1') {
        return -1;
    } else {
        for (int i = 3; i < strlen(binary); i++) {
            if (binary[i] == '1') {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
// Testing
#include <assert.h>
int main() {
    assert(sign("0b0100") == 1);
    assert(sign("0b1000") == -1);
    assert(sign("0b0000") == 0);
}
```

_Perform the following computations with 8-bit signed integers._
* Q23: `0b10100011 + 7`

    0b10100011 + 0b00000111 = 0b10101010 = -86

* Q24: `48 - 0b01100001`

    0b00110000 + 0b10011111 = 0b11001111 = -49
