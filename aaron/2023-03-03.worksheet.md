# Architecture: von Neumann
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-03-03_

## Announcements
* DEI assignment 2 due Thursday @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* von Neumann Architecture

## Warm-up

* _Two structs have been defined representing a queue and an item on a queue._


```c
struct item {
    int value;
    struct item *next;
};
struct queue {
    struct item *head;
    struct item *tail;
};
```

* _The `new_queue` function creates a new, empty queue._


```c
struct queue *new_queue() {
    struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
    q->head = NULL;
    q->tail = NULL;
    return q;
}
```

* Q1: _Write a function called `enqueue` that adds a new value at the end of the queue._

<p style="height:25em;"></p>

* Q2: _Write a function called `dequeue` that removes and returns the value at the head of the queue. The function should return -1 if the queue is empty._

<p style="height:25em;"></p>

## Building logic gates
* Q3: _Fill-in the truth tables for all six types of gates_

| A | B | A AND B | A OR B | NOT A | A NAND B | A NOR B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 0 | 1 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 1 | 0 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 1 | 1 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

* Q4: _How do you use AND and NOT gates to create a NAND gate?_

<p style="height:6em;"></p>

* Q5: _How do you use OR and NOT gates to create a NOR gate?_

<p style="height:6em;"></p>

## Extra practice

* Q6: _Write a function called `free_queue` that empties and frees a queue._

* Q7: _Write a function called `position` that takes a value and a queue and returns the position of the value within the queue (the head of the queue is position 0). Return -1 if the value is not present in the queue._
