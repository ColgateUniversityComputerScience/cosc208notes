## n-bit Circuits

* Q2: _Complete the truth-table for `A > B` when A and B are two bits_

| A1 A2 | B1 B2 | A > B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   0 | 0   0 |   0   |
| 0   1 | 0   0 |   1   |
| 1   0 | 0   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   1 |       |
