## Warm-up

* Q1: _What does the following program output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct coords {
    int x;
    int y;
};
struct coords *flip(struct coords *in) {
    struct coords *out = malloc(sizeof(struct coords));
    out->x = in->y;
    out->y = in->x;
    return out;
}
struct coords *modify(struct coords *point) {
    point->x *= 2;
    point->y *= 2;
    return point;
}
int main() {
    struct coords *one = malloc(sizeof(struct coords));
    one->x = 3;
    one->y = 4;
    struct coords *two = flip(one);
    printf("one %d, %d\n", one->x, one->y);
    printf("two %d, %d\n", two->x, two->y);
    struct coords *three = modify(two);
    three->y = one->y;
    one->x = 5;
    printf("one %d, %d\n", one->x, one->y);
    printf("two %d, %d\n", two->x, two->y);
    printf("three %d, %d\n", three->x, three->y);
}
```

## Logic gates

* Q2: _Fill-in the truth tables for all six types of logic gates_

| A | B | A AND B | A OR B | NOT A | A NAND B | A NOR B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 0 | 1 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 1 | 0 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 
| 1 | 1 |         |        |       |          |         |         | 

* Q3: _How do you use AND and NOT gates to create a NAND gate?_

* Q4: _How do you use OR and NOT gates to create a NOR gate?_

## Extra practice

* _Two structs have been defined representing a queue and an item on a queue._


```c
struct item {
    int value;
    struct item *next;
};
struct queue {
    struct item *head;
    struct item *tail;
};
```

* _The `new_queue` function creates a new, empty queue._


```c
struct queue *new_queue() {
    struct queue *q = malloc(sizeof(struct queue));
    q->head = NULL;
    q->tail = NULL;
    return q;
}
```

* Q5: _Write a function called `enqueue` that adds a new value at the end of the queue._

<p style="height:15em;"></p>

* Q6: _Write a function called `dequeue` that removes and returns the value at the head of the queue. The function should return -1 if the queue is empty._

<p style="height:15em;"></p>

* Q7: _Write a function called `free_queue` that empties and frees a queue._

<p style="height:15em;"></p>

* Q8: _Write a function called `position` that takes a value and a queue and returns the position of the value within the queue (the head of the queue is position 0). Return -1 if the value is not present in the queue._
