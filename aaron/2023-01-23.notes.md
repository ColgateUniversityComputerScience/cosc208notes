    * Review the syllabus
    * Read Dive Into Systems 0.0, 1.0-1.2.1 and answer pre-class questions

## Outline
* Getting to know each other
* What is a computer system?
* Syllabus highlights

## Getting to know Aaron
* My name is...Aaron Gember-Jacobson
* Please call me...Aaron
* My personal pronouns are...he/him
* Something I did over winter break that I enjoyed is...building Legos.
* Something about computer science I really enjoy is...writing programs in Python.
* Something I want you to know about my life at Colgate is...I strive to create equitable and inclusive learning environments, because I want to counteract systems of power and privilege within the field of computer science and within Colgate.
* Something I want you to know about my life outside of Colgate is...I live in Hamilton with my wife (Emily), kids (Henry, 7; Molly, 5), and cats (Hairy and Luna).

## What is a computer system?
* _What do you think of when you hear the term "computer systems"?_
* Main components of a computer system
    * Central processing unit (CPU) — executes assembly instructions
    * Random access memory (RAM) — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage devices (e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive stores) – program data (code, documents, etc.) persistently
    * Input/output (I/O) ports – receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
    * Operating system (OS) — manages hardware resources
* _Why is it important to learn about computer systems?_
    * To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism
* Course topics
    * C
    * Number representation
    * Program memory
    * Architecture
    * Assembly
    * Efficiency
    * Multiprocessing
    * Distributed systems

## Syllabus highlights
* Before each class, read listed textbook sections and answer pre-class questions on Moodle
    * Use the pre-class questions to guide your reading
    * For Wednesday: Read Dive Into Systems 0.0, 1.0-1.2.1 and answer pre-class questions
* Class meetings: warm-up problems, working through examples, clarifying concepts, individual and small group problem solving  
    * Everyone is expected to participate in class; it is okay to be wrong — I also do things wrong!
* Important dates
* Time management: start projects when they are released and work over multiple shorter sessions
* Deadlines: I will be reasonably flexible as long as you are responsible
* Academic honesty: I want you to succeed, and I will do everything I can to help you; violating the academic honesty expectations almost always leads to a bad experience for you and me
* Feedback on the course is always welcome
* Grading:
    * Everything is graded on a scale of 0 to 4, corresponding to F to A letter grades
    * No explit breakdown of coursework categories in the overall course grade – I will use my professional judgement
    * Progamming projects and exams (two midterms and a final) are the most critical of your assessed work
    * Pre-class questions, in-class activities, and DEI assignments are low-stakes activities which facilitate your learning
