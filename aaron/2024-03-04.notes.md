## Warm-up

* Q1: _Fill-in the truth table for the following logical operations_

| A | B | (A != B) | (A > B) | (A >= B) |
| - | - | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 0 | 0 |    0     |    0    |    1     |
| 0 | 1 |    1     |    0    |    0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1     |    1    |    1     |
| 1 | 1 |    0     |    0    |    1     |

## 1-bit circuits

* _Design the truth table: e.g., A != B_

| A | B | A != B |
| - | - | ------ |
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |   0    |

* For each row where the output value is 1:
    * Add an AND gate to the circuit
    * If an input value is 1, connect it to the AND gate
    * If an input value is 0, connect it to a NOT gate, then connect the output of the NOT gate to the AND gate
* Connect the output of all AND gates to a single OR gate

* _Can we build a circuit that uses fewer gates?_
    * `A XOR B`
    * `(A OR B) AND (NOT (A AND B))`

* Q2: _Create a circuit for `A > B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

`A AND NOT(B)`

* Q3: _Create a circuit for `A >= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

![](images/circuits/a_ge_b.png)

* Alternatives
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR (A AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND B)`
    * `(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) OR A`
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR A`
    * `NOT(NOT(A) AND B)`
    * `A OR NOT(B)`

## 1-bit addition circuit

_Your goal is to create a 1-bit circuit to perform addition. The circuit will take 3 input bits (`A`, `B`, and `I` = carry-in) and produce 2 output bits (`S` = sum and `O` = carry_out)._

* Q4: _Complete the truth table for this operation_

| `A` | `B` | `I` | `S` | `O` |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |

* Q6: _Draw the circuit for `S`_

![](images/circuits/sum.png)

* Q8: _Draw the circuit for `O`_

* Simplified: `(B AND I) OR (A AND I) OR (A AND B)`

* Q11: _How do you use NAND gates to create an OR gate?_
