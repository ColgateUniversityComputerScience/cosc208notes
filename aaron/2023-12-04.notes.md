## Announcements
* Project 4 due Thursday @ 11pm

## Outline
* SETs
* Warm-up
* Containers

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw a diagram of a system that does **not** use a hypervisor or containers._

* Q2: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 1 hypervisor**._

* Q3: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 2 hypervisor**._

## Containers

* Containers — use a single OS, but create groups of processes that are isolated from other processes
    * OS's process abstraction already isolates each process's CPU time, memory, and registers, but processes can still use syscalls to pass messages to each other, wait for each other, access a common set of files, etc.
* Containers share the kernel — i.e., core OS functionality like syscalls, scheduler, I/O interface
    * VMs do **not** share the kernel
* Containers and VMs do **not** share the file system ==> containers and virtual machines do **not** share libraries, executables, etc.
* Containers and VMs do **not** share user accounts
* Containers and VMs do **not** share network stacks ==> e.g., each container or VM has its own Internet Protocol (IP) address
* Compute and storage resources (e.g., CPU, memory) available to containers and VMs can be limited
* Containers and VMs share the hardware
