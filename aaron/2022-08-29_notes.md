_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-08-29_

## Announcements
* Before next class: Read Dive Into Systems 1.3-1.4.0 and answer pre-class questions
* Welcome Back CS Dept Tea: Tuesday at 11:30am in McGregory 319

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Learning community guidelines
* Hello, C
* Types
* Operators

## Warm-up
* Q1: _What are the main components of a computer system?_
    * Central processing unit (CPU)
    * Random access memory (RAM)
    * Secondary storage devices — e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive
    * Input/output (I/O) ports
    * Operating system (OS)
* _What is the role of each of the components?_
    * CPU — executes assembly instructions
    * RAM — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage — stores program data (code, documents, etc.) persistently
    * I/O ports — receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
    * OS — manages hardware resources
* _Why is it important to learn about computer systems?_
    * To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism

## Learning community guidelines
1. We will attempt to overcome fears of exposing our preconceptions and misunderstandings by openly answering and asking questions.
2. We will not demean, devalue, or "put down" people for their questions or contributions.
3. We will be actively aware of our "airtime": if we tend to be quieter, we pledge to lean in and contribute more; if we tend to dominate conversations, we pledge to lean out and listen more.

## Hello, C
* Write a C program that prints "Hello, C!"
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, C!\n");
        return 0:
    }
    ```
* _How do you compile the program?_
    ```bash
    $ clang -Wall -Werror -o hello hello.c
    ```
* _How do you run the program?_
    ```bash
    $ ./hello
    ```

## Primitive types
* Most common types
    * `char` — 1 byte (8-bits); integers -128...127; integers 0...127 correspond to ASCII characters
    * `int` — usually 4 bytes (32-bits); integers -2 billion...2 billion
    * `long `— usually 8 bytes (64-bits); integers -9 quintillion...9 quintillion
* Add `unsigned` in front of these types for a range from 0 to 255, 4 billion, or 18 quintillion, respectively

## Operators
* _How would I increment the number stored in a variable `x` by `1`?_
    * `x = x + 1`
    * `x += 1`
    * `x++`
    * `++x`
* Q2: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 2;
        x = x+5;
        printf("%d ", x);
        x = y*2;
        printf("%d ", x);
        x *= 5;
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", x--);
        printf("%d ", x);
        printf("%d ", --x);
        printf("%d", x);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```
* Q3: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        int y = x/2;
        int z = x%2;
        printf("%d %d\n", y, z);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```
* Q4: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        int x = 5;
        char y = 'A';
        y = y + 5;
        printf("%c %d\n", y, y);
    }
    ```
    ```

    ```

## Output
* Postponed to next class

## Extra practice
* Q8: _Write a program that computes and displays the number of minutes in a year._
    ```C
    int main() {
        int minutes = 365 * 24 * 60;
        printf("%d minutes\n", minutes);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
