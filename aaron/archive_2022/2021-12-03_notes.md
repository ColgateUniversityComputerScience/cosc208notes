## Warm-up
Q1: _What are the four layers of abstraction in computer networks?_

| Layer |  Role | 
|-------|-------|
| Application | Application-to-application |
| Transport | Process-to-process |
| Network | Host-to-host |
| Link | Node-to-node |

## Packet switching
* Before we discuss the transport layer: How does a message get from one machine to another?
* Early computers communicated using a dedicated connection (i.e., a circuit)
    * Similar to hiring a courier to take a package directly from the original house to its destination
    * _Why is this a bad approach?_
        * Need a connection to every computer you want to communicate with — does not scale
        * Cannot communicate if a connection fails — not fault tolerant
        * Connection is idle when computers have nothing to send — wastes resources
* _How were these issues addressed?_ — allow computers to communicate via other computers (i.e., store-and-forward networking)
    * Basic idea
        * Computer is directly connected to one or a few other computers
        * Send a message to a neighboring computer that is closer to the destination host
        * Computer stores the message in a queue until the connection to the next computer is available
    * Similar to a postal system
    * Can replace intermediate computer with a device dedicated solely to forwarding messages — called a router or switch
    * _Does this system scale?_ — yes, because you add more links and routers as necessary
    * _Is this system fault tolerant?_ — yes if you have connections to multiple neighbors (i.e., multi-homed), because you can send via a different neighbor
    * _Does this system waste resources?_ — no, because connections are shared (i.e., multiplexing)
    * _Is there anything else wrong with this approach?_ 
        * Small messages can get stuck behind large messages (i.e., head-of-line-blocking)
        * Neighbor may not be able to store full message
* _How were these issues addressed?_ — break messages into small fragments called packets
    * Packet-switched network — store-and-forward networking with packets
        * Introduces new issues
            * Parts of a message may be reordered
            * Parts of a message may be lost

## Transport layer
* Responsibilities 
    * Break messages into packets
    * Put packets in the proper order upon arrival
    * Retransmit missing packets
* _Why is the transport layer implemented by the operating system instead of by applications?_ — many applications need the same functionality
* Also provides flow control (to avoid overloading the receiving host) and congestion control (to avoid overloading the intermediate routers)

## Addressing system requirements
Q2: _How are destinations specified in the real world? For example, if you wanted a taxi driver to take you to a particular restaurant, how would you specify your destination? What are the advantages/disadvantages of different approaches?_
* Restaurant name
    * Easy for humans to remember
    * Imprecise — could be multiple restaurants with the same name
* Landmark
    * Easy for humans to remember
    * Imprecise — not actually the final destination
* Street address — number, street, city, state, zip
    * Precise
    * No overlap — although there could be multiple restaurants in the same building, so we need an additional identifier (e.g., suite number)
    * Harder for humans to remember — e.g., What is Flour & Salt's street address?
* Latitude/longitude
    * Precise
    * Hard for humans to remember — e.g., What is Colgate's latitude/longitude?
