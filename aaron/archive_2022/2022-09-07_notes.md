* Binary <-> hex conversion

## Warm-up
* Q1: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    int main() {
        char first[] = "Colgate";
        char second[10] = "Univ";
        printf("%lu %lu\n", strlen(first));
        printf("%lu %lu\n", strlen(second));
        first[strlen(first)] = '-';
        second[strlen(second)-1] = '.';
        printf("%s%s\n", first, second);
        first[3] = '.';
        first[4] = '\0';
        printf("%s %s\n", first, second);
    }
    ```
    ```

* Q2: _Write a program that asks the user for a string and prints the string backwards._
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    int main() {
        char str[100];
        printf("String? ");
        fgets(str, 100, stdin);
        for (int i = strlen(str); i >= 0; i--) {
            printf("%c", str[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    ```

## Decimal (i.e., base 10)
* _How many unique values can you represent with one decimal digit?_ -- 10
* _How do you count to 13 (in base 10)?_ -- 0 (computers like to start at zero!), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (notice the "ones" place becomes zero and the "tens" place becomes 1), 11, 12, 13

## Binary (i.e., base 2)
* We are used to working with decimal numbers, but computers represent numbers in binary
    * A single binary digit (_bit_) can represent two unique values — 0 or 1
    * It is easier to build hardware that uses polar opposites (e.g., on/off, high/low voltage, positive/negative magnetism, etc.) than multiple levels (e.g., very high, high, moderately high, moderate, moderately low, low, very low voltage)
* _How many unique values can be represented with 2 bits?_ — 00, 01, 10, 00; 2^2 = 4
    * _3 bits?_ — 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111; 2^3 = 8
* Practice powers of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192
* _How many bits are in a byte?_ -- 8 bits
* _How many unique values can be represented with 1 byte? 4 bytes? -- 256, ~4.3 billion
* _How do you count to 13 in binary?_ -- 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101
* _Convert these binary numbers to decimal (i.e., base 10):_
    * Q3: `0b11` = 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 2 + 1 = 3
    * Q4: `0b1010` = 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 2 = 10
    * Q5: `0b11001100` = 1 * 2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 0 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 128 + 64 + 8 + 4 = 204

## Hexadecimal (i.e., base 16)
_Postponed to next class_

## Binary <-> Hex Conversion
_Postponed to next class_

## Extra practice
* Q15: _Write a function called `count_words` that takes a string and counts the number of words in the string. Assume each word is separated by a single space, and the string will contain at least one word. For example, `"Today is Wednesday."` contains 3 words._
```C
int count_words(char str[]) {
    int words = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == ' ') {
            words++;
        }
    }
    return words;
}
```
* _Convert these binary numbers to decimal (i.e., base 10):_
    * Q16: `0b10` = 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 2
    * Q17: `0b1111` = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15
* _Convert these hexadecimal numbers to decimal (i.e., base 10):_
    * _Postponed to next class_ 
* _Convert these binary numbers to hexadecimal:_ 
    * _Postponed to next class_
* _Convert these hexadecimal numbers to binary:_
    * _Postponed to next class_
* Q27: _Write a function called `abbreviate` that takes a string and modifies the string in place to include only the first letter of each word. For example, `"Talk To You Later"` is converted to `TTYL`._
    ```C
    void abbreviate(char str[]) {
        int store = 1;
        int check = 1;
        while (check < strlen(str)) {
            if (str[check-1] == ' ') {
                str[store] = str[check];
                store++;
            }
            check++;
        }
        str[store] = '\0';
    }
    ```
