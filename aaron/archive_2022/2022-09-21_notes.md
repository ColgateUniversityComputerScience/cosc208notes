## Outline
* Exam 1 review

## No warm-up — happy Monday!

## Binary arithmetic
_Perform the following calculations. Operands are encoded using two's complement encoding with 6 bits. For each calculation, express the result in binary and decimal, and indicate whether the result overflows, underflows, or neither._
* Q1: `0b110000 + 0b111111 = 0b101111 = -17`; neither
* Q2: `0b001111 + 0b000001 = 0b010000 = 16`; neither
* Q3: `0b101010 + 0b100100 = 0b001110 = 14`; underflow
* Q4: `0b001000 + 0b011000 = 0b100000 = -32`; overflow
* Q5: `0b110000 + 0b010000 = 0b000000 = 0`; neither

## Logical & bitwise operators
_For each of the following expressions, select all operators that make the expression evaluate to true. Operands are encoded using two's complement._
* Q6: `0b110000 __ 0b111111` — `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `^`, `<`
* Q7: `0b011110 __ 0b000001` — `&&`, `|`, `||`, `^`
* Q8: `0b000000 __ 0b000000` — _none_
* Q9: `0b000111 __ 0b000111` — `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`

## Strings
* Q10: _The following program should ask the user to enter a word, then print the word's length and whether it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward). For example, if the user enters `"kayak"` the program should print `"The word is 5 characters long and is a palindrome."` However, the program contains several errors. Modify the program to correct the errors._
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>

    void palindrome(char word[]) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = strlen(word);
        while (i < j) {
            if (word[i] != word[j]) {
                return -1;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return 1;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("Enter a word: ");
        char word[50];
        fgets(word, 50, stdin);
        word[strlen(word)-1] = '\0'; // Remove newline
        int len = strlen(word);
        printf("The word is %c characters long and is ", len);
        if (palindrome(word)) {
            printf("a palindrome.\n");
        } else {
            printf("not a palindrome.\n");
        }
    }
    ```
    * `#include <string.h>`
    * Change return type of `palindrome` to `int`
    * Initialize `j` to `strlen(word) - 1`
    * Change `return -1` to `return 0`
    * Change `%c` in 2nd `printf` in `main` to `%d`
* Q11: _Write a function called `molecular_formula` that takes a string containing the constituent atoms of a molecule and updates the string to contain the molecular formula. For example, the string `"HHO"` should be changed to `"H20"`, and the string `"HHSOOOO"` should be changed to `"H2SO4"`. You can assume:_
    * _Molecules will only contain elements that are represented by a single letter — e.g., a molecule may contain `'H'` but not `"Na"`_
    * _All atoms of the same element are listed consecutively — e.g., the constituent atoms may be provided as `"HHO"` but not `"HOH"`_
    * _The elements are listed in the order they should appear in the molecular formula — e.g., the constituent atoms `"HHO"` are changed to the molecular formula `"H2O"`, whereas the constituent atoms `"OHH"` are changed to the molecular formula `"OH2"`_
    * _There will be at most 9 atoms of each element — e.g., `"H9C9"` may occur, but `"H10C11"` will not occur_
    ```C
    void molecular_formula(char elements[]) {
        int count = 1;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= strlen(elements); i++) {
            if (elements[i] != elements[i-1]) {
                elements[j] = elements[i-1];
                j++;
                if (count > 1) {
                    elements[j] = count + '0';
                    j++;
                }
                count = 0;
            }
            count++;
        }
        elements[j] = '\0';
    }
    ```

## Number base conversions
_Perform the following conversions_
* Q12: `97` to 8-bit unsigned binary = `0b01100001`
* Q13: `-42` to 8-bit two's complement = `0b11010110`
* Q14: `0b11001100` to unsigned decimal = `128 + 64 + 8 + 4` = `204`
* Q15: `0b11001100` to signed decimal = `-52`
* Q16: `0x27` to unsigned decimal = `39`
* Q17: `0xDEAD` to 16-bit binary = `0b1101111010101101`

## Pointers
* Q18: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>

    int main() {
        char first[10] = "Go";
        char second[] = "Raiders";
        char *f = first;
        char *s = &second[1];
        printf("%d %d\n", strlen(f), strlen(s));
        *(s+2) = 'n';
        f += 1;
        *(++f) = 't';
        first[3] = '\0';
        second[4] = '\0';
        printf("%d %d\n", strlen(f), strlen(s));
        printf("%s %s\n", first, second);
    }
    ```
    ```

* Q19: _What is the output of this program?_
    ```C
    #include <stdio.h>

    void modify(char *str, int idx) {
        char tmp = str[0];
        idx--;
        str[0] = str[idx];
        str[idx] = tmp;
    }

    int main() {
        char a[5] = "none";
        char b[3] = "no";
        char *x = &(a[1]);
        printf("%s %s\n", b, x);

        char *y = b;
        int i = strlen(y);
        printf("%s %d\n", y, i);

        modify(y, i);
        printf("%s-%s-%s %d\n", x, y, x, i);

        *(a+2) = '\0';
        i = strlen(a);
        printf("%s %d\n", a, i);
    }
