_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-02-27_

## Announcements
* Programming project 2 due Thursday @ 11pm
* Professor candidate talks this week:
    * Tues 11:30am-12pm, McGregory 319: ‚ÄúWave Function Collapse (not the physics one)‚Äù, David Perkins
    * Thurs 11:30am-12:30pm, McGregory 319: ‚ÄúWhat neural models tell us about linguistic knowledge: insights from cross-linguistic investigations‚Äù, Forrest Davis

## Outline
* Warm-up
* 2D arrays on the stack
* 2D arrays a linear arrays
* 2D arrays as array-of-arrays
* Command-line arguments

## Warm-up
* Q1: _Assume you wanted to write a function that creates a copy of a string. What is wrong with each of the following attempts at writing such a function?_


```c
#include <string.h>
char *copy1(char strA[]) {
    char strB[strlen(strA) + 1];
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return strB;
}
```

    You cannot return a locally-declared array


```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
char copy2(char strA[]) {
    char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(strA) + 1));
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return *strB;
}
```

    Returns the first character in the copy, instead of an array of characters


```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
char *copy3(char strA[]) {
    char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char *));
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return strB;
}
```

    Allocates space for a pointer, not space for the number of characters in strA

## 2D arrays on the stack
* Assume we wanted to create an array to represent a calendar:
    ```
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
    ```
    * 4 rows = 4 weeks; 7 columns = 7 days in a week
* Q2: _Write a function called `fill_calendar` that creates a 2D array on the stack and populates the array with the appropriate values._



```c
void fill_calendar() {
    int calendar[4][7];
    int day = 1;
    for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
        for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
            calendar[week][dow] = day;
            day++;
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    fill_calendar();
}
```

* _Can we use a formula to compute the day based on week and day-of-week (dow)?_
    ```C
    day = week * 7 + dow + 1;
    ```
* _Can we return the `calendar` array from this function?_ ‚Äì no, it is stored in the stack and will go away when the function returns

## 2D arrays as linear arrays

* Can also think of a calendar as fully linear, like a number line or time line

* Q3: _Fill-in the blanks to complete the `fill_calendar_linear` function which creates a fully linear calendar._
    ```C
    void fill_calendar_linear() {
        int calendar[_____];
        int day = 1;
        for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
            for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
                calendar[__________________] = day;
                day++;
            }
        }
    }
    ```


```c
void fill_calendar_linear() {
    int calendar[4 * 7]; // 4 * 7
    int day = 1;
    for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
        for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
            calendar[week * 7 + dow] = day;
            day++;
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    fill_calendar_linear();
}
```

* 2D array indices "map to" 1D array indices
    ```
     (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  ...  (3,6) (3,7)
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |     |  27 |  28 |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    ```
* _Can we the change code such that the function can safely return `calendar`?_

int *fill_calendar_linear_heap() {
    int *calendar = malloc(sizeof(int) * 28);
    ...
    return calendar;
}

* Only need a single call to malloc üòÄ
* Determining indices is hard üòï

## 2D arrays as array-of-arrays

* _An array is a..._ ‚Äì pointer
* _What does our "outer" array store?_ ‚Äì¬†pointers
* _What does each "inner" array store?_ ‚Äì integers

* Example


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int **fill_calendar_arrayofarrays_heap() {
    int **calendar = malloc(sizeof(int *) * 4);
    int day = 1;
    for (int week = 0; week < 4; week++) {
        calendar[week] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 7);
        for (int dow = 0; dow < 7; dow++) {
            calendar[week][dow] = day;
            day++;
        }
    }
    return calendar;
}
```

* _How are strings represented in C?_¬†‚Äî array of characters, ending with a null character
* An array of strings is an array of arrays
* _What does our "outer" array store?_ ‚Äì pointers, because arrays (of characters) are pointers
* _What do our "inner" arrays store?_ ‚Äì characters, because strings are arrays of characters

* Q4: _Draw a memory diagram depicting the contents of the stack and heap immediately before the function `elongate("dog")` returns._


```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
char **elongate(char *str) {
    char **result = malloc(sizeof(char *) * strlen(str));
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++) {
        result[i] = malloc(sizeof(char) * (i + 2));
        for (int j = 0; j < i+1; j++) {
            result[i][j] = str[j];
        }
        result[i][i+1] = '\0';
    }
    return result;
}
int main() {
    elongate("dog");
}
```

## Command-line arguments

* Arguments entered on the command line separated by spaces are passed to `main`
    ```bash
    ./myprog abc 123
    ```

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
    }
}
```

* _Why is `argv` an array of character pointers?_ ‚Äì we want an array of strings; strings are arrays and arrays and pointers
* _Why do we need `argc`?_
    * We only include a null character at the end of a string (i.e., an array of characters); we don't include a null character at the end of other types of arrays (e.g., arrays of pointers)
    * Arrays are pointers, which contain the memory address of the first element of the array
    * Length of array is not encoded in array variable, nor is there a special ending indicator --> we need to know how many pointers are in the array, so we don't go beyond the end of the array
