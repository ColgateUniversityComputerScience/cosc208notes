## Announcements
* Before class on Monday:
    * Complete "Getting to know you" questionnaire
    * Review the syllabus
    * Read Dive Into Systems 16.0-16.2.1, 16.3
* First lab next week

## Getting to know Aaron
* Please call me...Aaron _or_ Professor Aaron
* My pronouns are...he/him
* Two things I like to do for fun are...building with Legos, and doing house projects.
* Besides my courses, I expect to spend significant time each week...handling administrative matters for the department in my role as department chair.
* Something you could do to make this a better teaching environment for me is...arriving to class on time.

## What is a computer system?
* _What do you think of when you hear the term "computer systems"?_
* Main components of a computer system
    * Central processing unit (CPU) — executes assembly instructions
    * Random access memory (RAM) — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
    * Secondary storage devices (e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive stores) – persistently stores program data (code, documents, etc.)
    * Input/output (I/O) ports – receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
    * Operating system (OS) — manages hardware resources
* Why is it important to learn about computer systems?
    * To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
    * To write more efficient programs
    * To leverage parallelism
* Course topics – see the standards in the _Quizzes_ section of the syllabus
    * Data representation
    * Program memory
    * Architecture
    * Assembly
    * Storage
    * Operating Systems & Concurrency

## Syllabus highlights
* Important dates
* Preparing for class: read textbook sections
    * For Monday: Read Dive Into Systems 16.0-16.2.1, 16.3
* Quizzes and projects: demonstrate that you undertand and can apply the concepts covered in the course
    * Quizzes during the last ~20 minutes of class every Friday, starting next Friday
    * Each quiz has 3-4 questions that each focus on one of the standards listed in the grading section of the syllabus
    * First of four projects will be released in ~2 weeks and beta version is due Tues, Sept 24
* Academic integrity: 
    * Do not share or copy code from other students
    * Indicate if code is copied from an external source
    * I want you to succeed; I will be reasonably flexible on deadlines
* Alternative grading:
    * Designed to be equitable and encourage learning and growth
    * Constructive feedback coupled with opportunities to revise and reattempt work without penalty – e.g., every standard will appear on two quizzes, and you need to acheive satisfactory once; every project can be revised to improve its functionality and design
    * Course grade is based on the extent to which your work on quizzes and projects is satisfactory – you must satisfy all requirements for a given letter grade
* Seek help and support!
