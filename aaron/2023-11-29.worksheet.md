# Efficiency: making programs multi-threaded

## No warm-up: Happy Wednesday

## Practice writing multi-threaded programs

* Q1: _Write a function called `sum_array` which takes an array of `ARRAY_LEN` integers and returns the sum of the integers. Your function should have the appropriate prototype/implementation to serve as the entry point for a thread. Assume `ARRAY_LEN` is a constant which has been `#define`d._

* Q2: _Write a function called `sum_matrix` which takes an array of `NUM_ARRAYS` arrays of integers (i.e., an `int **`) and returns the sum of all the integers. The function should create `NUM_ARRAYS` threads, each running the `sum_array` function for a single array of integers. Assume `NUM_ARRAYS` is a constant which has been `#define`d._

## Transforming programs to be multi-threaded

* _Assume you are given the following code:_


```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int count(char *str, char ch) {
    int num = 0;
    while (*str != '\0') {
        if (tolower(*str) == ch) {
            num++;
        }
        str++;
    }
    return num;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("Error: provide a string\n");
        return 1;
    }
    char *str = argv[1];
    char *vowels = "aeiou";
    int counts[strlen(vowels)];
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(vowels); i++) {
        counts[i] = count(str, vowels[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(vowels); i++) {
        printf("%c %d\n", vowels[i], counts[i]);
    }
}
```

* Q3: _Write a function called  `count_wrapper` that has the signature required for a thread function and calls the `count` function. (Hint: you'll need to declare a `struct` that contains all of the parameters required for `count`.)_

* Q4: _Re-write `main` to create/wait for threads that execute `count_wrapper` (instead of calling `count` sequentially)._
