* Warm-up
* Processing unit
* Assembly instructions

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw a circuit that takes two 3-bit unsigned numbers (`0b A2 A1 A0` and `0b B2 B1 B0`) and outputs a single bit that indicates whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number. Assume you have access to an unlimited supply of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates and 1-bit greater-than, less-than, and equal-to circuits, as shown below_

## Extra practice

* Q2: _Draw a circuit that takes two 3-bit **signed** numbers (`0b A2 A1 A0` and `0b B2 B1 B0`) and outputs a single bit that indicates whether the first number is **greater than** the second number. Assume you have access to an unlimited supply of `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates and 1-bit greater-than, less-than, and equal-to circuits._
