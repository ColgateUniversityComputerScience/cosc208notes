_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2024-02-26_

## Announcements
* Project 1 due today @ 11pm
* Quiz 2 in class Wednesday
    * 1.1: Develop C **code** that appropriately manipulates numbers, characters, and strings
    * 1.2: Convert signed and unsigned numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal
    * 1.3: Compute the results of arithmetic and bitwise operators in binary
    * 2.1: Determine the contents of the stack and heap during a program’s execution
    * 2.2: Develop C **code** that appropriately uses arrays and pointer arithmetic

## Outline
* Warm-up
* free
* 2D arrays
* Command-line arguments

## Warm-up
* Q1: _Assume you wanted to write a function that creates a copy of a string. What is wrong with each of the following attempts at writing such a function?_


```c
#include <string.h>
char *copy1(char strA[]) {
    char strB[strlen(strA) + 1];
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return strB;
}
```

    You cannot return a locally-declared array


```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
char copy2(char strA[]) {
    char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(strA) + 1));
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return *strB;
}
```

    Returns the first character in the copy, instead of an array of characters


```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
char *copy3(char strA[]) {
    char *strB = malloc(sizeof(char *));
    strcpy(strB, strA);
    return strB;
}
```

    Allocates space for a pointer, not space for the number of characters in strA

## free

* `void free(void *block)`
* When to free? — when a value stored on the heap is no longer needed
    * Free memory regions as soon as you are done
    * Do not read/write the memory location after it has been freed!

* _What memory deallocation mistake has been made in each of the following programs?_


```c
// Q2
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    free(ptrA);
    free(ptrB);
}
```

_Double free_


```c
// Q3
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    ptr++;
    free(ptr);
}
```

_Not freeing from beginning of allocated region_


```c
// Q4
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int *ptrA = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
    int *ptrB = ptrA;
    ptrA[0] = 0;
    ptrB[1] = 1;
    free(ptrA);
    ptrB[2] = 2;
}
```

_Use after free_

## 2D arrays
* Assume we wanted to represent a Tic Tac Toe board
    ```
    +---+---+---+
    | X |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   | X |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   | O |   |
    +---+---+---+
    ```

* _How would we create an empty board?_ – need to create a 2D array
* _How would we represent one row of the board?_ – as an array of characters


```c
// First attempt
#include <stdlib.h>
#define BOARD_SIZE 3
??? create_board() {
    char *top_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    char *middle_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    char *bottom_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    return ???; // How do we return three arrays?
}
```

* Create an array-of-arrays
* _An array is a..._ – pointer
* _What does an array-of-arrays store?_ – pointers
* _What is an array-of-arrays?_ – a pointer to the zeroth element that is a pointer to the zeroth element


```c
// Second attempt
#include <stdlib.h>
#define BOARD_SIZE 3
char **create_board() {
    char *top_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    char *middle_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    char *bottom_row = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
    char **board = malloc(sizeof(char *) * BOARD_SIZE);
    board[0] = top_row;
    board[1] = middle_row;
    board[2] = bottom_row;
    return board;
}
```


```c
// Final version
#include <stdlib.h>
#define BOARD_SIZE 3
char **create_board() {
    char **board = malloc(sizeof(char *) * BOARD_SIZE);
    for (int r = 0; r < BOARD_SIZE; r++) {
        board[r] = malloc(sizeof(char) * BOARD_SIZE);
        for (int c = 0; c < BOARD_SIZE; c++) {
            board[r][c] = ' ';
        }
    }
    return board;
}
```

## Command-line arguments

* Arguments entered on the command line separated by spaces are passed to `main`
    ```bash
    ./myprog abc 123
    ```

* Example


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
    }
}
```

* _Why is `argv` an array of character pointers?_ – we want an array of strings; strings are arrays and arrays and pointers
* _Why do we need `argc`?_
    * We only include a null character at the end of a string (i.e., an array of characters); we don't include a null character at the end of other types of arrays (e.g., arrays of pointers)
    * Arrays are pointers, which contain the memory address of the first element of the array
    * Length of array is not encoded in array variable, nor is there a special ending indicator --> we need to know how many pointers are in the array, so we don't go beyond the end of the array
