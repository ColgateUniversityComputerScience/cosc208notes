    "* Purpose of an OS\n",
    "    * Make computer hardware easy to use—e.g., an OS knows how to load an application's executable code from persistent storage (e.g., solid state drive (SSD)) into main memory, initialize the process's address space (code, heap, stack), and make the CPU execute the application's instructions\n",
    "    * Support multiprocessing—i.e., running multiple applications concurrently\n",
    "        * Concurrently == switch between multiple tasks during a window of time—e.g., alternate between cooking and setting the table\n",
    "        * Simultaneously == complete two tasks at the same time—e.g., listen to a podcast while cooking\n",
    "    * Allocate and manage hardware resources—e.g., decide when/which applications can use the CPU, decide when/which memory applications can use, prevent applications from stealing/accessing another application's CPU time or memory\n",
    "    * Many OSes also provide a user interface (UI)\n",
    "* How does the OS fulfill its duties?\n",
    "    * Mechanisms — fundamental approaches for managing/providing access to hardware resources\n",
    "        * E.g., system calls, process abstraction\n",
    "    * Policy — specific ways of employing an approach; different policies make different trade-offs (in terms of efficiency, performance, etc.)\n",
    "        * E.g., process scheduler"
