## Outline
* Processor design

## Processor Design 

* Q1: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has two general purpose registers (r0 and r1) and supports four bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`). Assume you already have storage, MUX, DMUX, and bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) circuits available as building blocks._

* Q2: _For this processor's assembly language, how many bits are required for the operation code?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q3: _For this processor's assembly language, how many bits are required for a complete instruction?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q4: _What is the binary representation of the assembly instruction for `r0 = r0 ^ r1`?_

* Q5: _If the processing unit is fed the instruction `0b11110` what will the processing unit do?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q6: _If the processing unit you is fed the instruction `0b11111` what will the processing unit do?_

<p style="height:3em;"></p>

* Q7: _If the processing unit contained 16 registers instead of 2, how many bits would be required for a complete assembly instruction?_

## Extra practice

* Q9: _Draw the circuitry for a processing unit that has four general purpose registers (r0-r3) and supports four operations:_
    * `nop`: no operation; do nothing
    * `mov`: copy a value from one register to another
    * `movc`: store a constant value into a register, where the constant comes from the last four bits of the instruction
    * `add`: add the values in two registers and store the result in a register
