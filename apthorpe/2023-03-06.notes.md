## Warm-up

* Q1 & Q2: _Fill-in the truth tables for all six types of logic gates_

| A | B | A AND B | A OR B | NOT A | A NAND B | A NOR B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |    0    |   0    |   1   |     1    |    1    |    0    | 
| 0 | 1 |    0    |   1    |   1   |     1    |    0    |    1    | 
| 1 | 0 |    0    |   1    |   0   |     1    |    0    |    1    | 
| 1 | 1 |    1    |   1    |   0   |     0    |    0    |    0    | 

## Logic gates

* Transistors — switches that control electrical flow; output state depends on current state plus input state
* Logic gates — created from transistors; implement boolean operations (AND, NO, NOT, etc.)
* A chip is easier to build if it contains fewer types of gates

* Q3: _How do you use AND and NOT gates to create a NAND gate?_

* Q4: _How do you use OR and NOT gates to create a NOR gate?_

## 1-bit Circuits

* Circuit — created from logic gates

* Q5: _Fill-in the truth table for the following logical operations_

| A | B | (A != B) | (A > B) | (A >= B) |
| - | - | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 0 | 0 |    0     |    0    |    1     |
| 0 | 1 |    1     |    0    |    0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1     |    1    |    1     |
| 1 | 1 |    0     |    0    |    1     |

* _Design the truth table: e.g., A != B_

| A | B | A != B |
| - | - | ------ |
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |
| 1 | 1 |   0    |

* For each row where the output value is 1:
    * Determine how to make each input 1 — e.g., either `A` or `NOT(A)`
    * Conjunct the two subexpressions — e.g., `NOT(A) AND B`
* Create the disjunction of the expressions for each row — e.g., `(NOT(A) AND B) OR (A AND NOT(B))`
* Create a circuit from left to right, starting with the inner-most subexpressions

* _Can we build a circuit that uses fewer gates?_
    * `A XOR B`
    * `(A OR B) AND (NOT (A AND B))`

        ![](images/circuits/gate_xor.png)


* Q6: _Create a circuit for `A > B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

`A AND NOT(B)`

![](images/circuits/a_gt_b.png)

* Q7: _Create a circuit for `A >= B` using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` gates_

`(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND B)`

![](images/circuits/a_ge_b.png)

* Alternatives
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR (A AND NOT(B)) OR (A AND B)`
    * `(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) OR A`
    * `(NOT(A OR B)) OR A`
    * `NOT(NOT(A) AND B)`
    * `A OR NOT(B)`

## 1-bit addition circuit

_Your goal is to create a 1-bit circuit to perform addition. The circuit will take 3 input bits (`A`, `B`, and `I` = carry-in) and produce 2 output bits (`S` = sum and `O` = carry_out)._

* Q8: _Complete the truth table for this operation_

| `A` | `B` | `I` | `S` | `O` |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
|  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |

* Q9: _What is the boolean expression for `S`?_

```
(NOT(A) AND NOT(B) AND I)
OR (NOT(A) AND B AND NOT(I))
OR (A AND NOT(B) AND NOT(I))
OR (A AND B AND I) 
```

* Q10: _Draw the circuit for `S`_

![](images/circuits/sum.png)

* Q11: _What is the boolean expression for `O`?_

```
(NOT(A) AND B AND I)
OR (A AND NOT(B) AND I)
OR (A AND B AND NOT(I))
OR (A AND B AND I)
```
Simplified:
```
(B AND I) OR (A AND I) OR (A AND B)
```

* Q12: _Draw the circuit for `O`_
