* Bitwise operators
* Real numbers

## Warm-up
_Perform the following computations with 8-bit signed integers._
* Q1: `0b10100011 + 7`

    0b10100011 + 0b00000111 = 0b10101010 = -86

* Q2: `48 - 0b01100001`

    0b00110000 + 0b10011111 = 0b11001111 = -49

* Q3: `0b00100000 + 0b01100000`

    0b10000000 = -128 (overflow occurred)

## Overflow

* 32 + 96 = -128!? What!?
* Computation overflowed — i.e., result is too large to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to negative numbers
    * Can only occur when you add two positive numbers
* Computation can also underflow — i.e., result is too small to be represented
    * Computation wraps around to positive numbers
    * E.g., -64 + -65 = `0b11000000` + `0b10111111` = `0b01111111` = 127
    * Can only occur when you add two negative numbers
* Overflow and underflow are impossible when adding a positive number and a negative number
    * Assume you add the largest magnitude positive number and the smallest magnitude negative number (-1); the result will be slightly less magnitude than the positive operand, and thus cannot overflow
    * Assume you add the smallest magnitude positive number (1) and the largest magnitude negative number; the result will be slightly less magnitude than the negative operand, and thus cannot underflow
* _What happens if you overflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to zero, and get a smaller positive integer
* _What happens if you underflow with unsigned integers?_ — you wrap around to the maximum value, and get a larger positive integer

_For each of the following computations, determine whether the computation overflows, underflows, or neither. Assume we are using 8-bit signed integers._
* Q4: `0b10000000 + 0b01111111`

    neither

* Q5: `0b10000001 + 0b01111111`

    neither

* Q6: `0b10000000 + 0b10000001`

    underflow

* Q7: `0b11000000 + 0b11000000`

    neither

* Q8: `0b01111111 + 0b00000001`

    overflow

## Bitwise operators

* Apply an operation to a single bit (not) or a pair of bits (and, or, xor)
* `~` (not)
    * Flips bits: if bit is 0, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `~0b101` = `0b010`
* `&` (and)
    * If both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 & 0b0011` = `0b0001`
    * This is different than logical and (`&&`) which checks whether both operands are non-zero
* `|` (or)
    * If either or both bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 | 0b0011` = `0b0111`
    * This is different than logical or (`||`) which checks whether at least one operand is non-zero
* `^` (xor)
    * If either, but not both, bits are 1, then result is 1; otherwise, result is 0
    * Example: `0b0101 ^ 0b0011` = `0b0110`
* `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift)
    * Move bits to the left or the right and append or prepend zeros to keep the same number of bits
    * Example: `0b1111 << 0b0010` = `0b1100`
    * Example: `0b1111 >> 0b0001` = `0b0111`
    * Can use bit shifting to multiply or divide by powers of two

* Q9: `0b1010 | 0b0101`

    0b1111

* Q10: `0b1010 & 0b0101`

    0b0000

* Q11: `~(0b1100 & 0b0110)`

    ~0b0100 = 0b1011

* Q12: `0b1000 >> 0b011`

    0b0001 (divide by 2^3)

* Q13: `0b0001 << 0b0010`

    0b0100 (multiply by 2^2)

* Q14: `0b1111 & (~0b0010)`

    0b1111 & 0b1101 = 0b1101 (clear a bit)

* Q15: `0b0000 | 0b0010`

    0b0010 (set a bit)

## Real numbers
* Real numbers may have fractional parts -- e.g., `3.14`
* _How can we encode real numbers?_
* Fixed-point representation
    * Location of decimal point is fixed — some bits encode whole numbers, and some bits encode fractional numbers
    * Example: 8-bit fixed point with 3 bits for the fractional part: `0b01011010` = 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^-1 + 1 * 2^-2 + 0 * 2^-3 = 8 + 2 + 1 + 0.25 = 11.25
    * _What is an advantage of fixed-point representation?_
        * Easy to compute
    * _What is a disadvantage of fixed-point representation?_ 
        * Range of real numbers is fixed — cannot represent large whole numbers or small fractional numbers
* Float-point representation
    * Uses a "scaling factor" to multiply (or divide) fractional part
    * Bits in the significand represent (from left to right) 2^-1, 2^-2, ... 2^-23
    * Bits in the exponent represent an unsigned integer 0 - 255
    * Multiply significand by 2^(exponent - 127) to get final result
    * Can represent large whole numbers **or** small fractional numbers, but not a large whole number with a small fractional part

## Extra practice
* Q16: _Write a function called `sign` that takes a number expressed in binary using two's complement and returns `-1` if the number is negative, `0` if the number is zero, or `1` if the number is positive. The binary is stored as a character array that starts with `0b` and contains an arbitrary number of `'0'` and `'1'` characters._


```c
#include <string.h>
int sign(char binary[]) {
    if (binary[2] == '1') {
        return -1;
    } else {
        for (int i = 3; i < strlen(binary); i++) {
            if (binary[i] == '1') {
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
// Testing
#include <assert.h>
int main() {
    assert(sign("0b0100") == 1);
    assert(sign("0b1000") == -1);
    assert(sign("0b0000") == 0);
}
```
