# Efficiency: Loop interchange; threads
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-11-15_

## Loop interchange

* Example


```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define LEN 12
int main() {
    int *array = malloc(sizeof(int) * LEN);

    for (int i = 0; i < LEN; i++) {
        array[i] = i;
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < LEN; k += 4) {
            sum += array[j+k];
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
}
```

* Q3: _Would loop interchange improve the efficiency of this code?_


```c
void hundreds() {
    int *nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * 1000);
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i+= 100) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
            nums[i+j] = i;
        }
    }
}
```

* Q4: _Would loop interchange improve the efficiency of this code?_


```c
void multiplication(int grid[][], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            grid[r][c] = c * r;
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Extra practice

Q6: _For each of the following scenarios, indicate whether it is an example of temporal locality, spatial locality, or neither._

* Gates for flights on the same airline are located in the same airport terminal/concourse
* A grocery list is arranged in alphabetical order
* Clothes in a closet are grouped into outfits, with a shirt and a pair of pants stored next to each other
* Boxes of cereal, bowls, and spoons are stored in adjacent kitchen cabinets/drawers
* You repeatedly check your phone for new messages
* A variable used in a for loop
* Variables used in different functions
* A function's parameters, which are each used once within the function

Q7: _For each of the following instances of caching, indicate whether the caching is motivated by temporal or spatial locality._

* A CPU caches the first 32 instructions of a function when the function is called
* A CPU caches all of the instructions for a frequently called function
* A web browser caches the Moodle pages for your courses, which you view multiple times per week
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches a video that has gone viral
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches "recommended videos" related to a video
