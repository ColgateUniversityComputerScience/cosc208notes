# Efficiency: Locality; caching
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-11-13_

## Announcements
* Project 3 due today @ 11pm

## Warm-up

* Q1: _For each of the following characteristics, circle the type(s) of memory to which the characteristic applies. (HDD = Hard Disk Drive; RAM = Random Access Memory; SSD = Solid State Drive)_

| Characteristic | | | | | |
|-----|-|-|-|-|-|
| <br/>Cheapest<br/><br/> | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>Fastest<br/><br/> | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>On CPU<br/><br/> | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>Volatile<br/><br/> | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>Size measured in megabytes (MB)<br/>in a present day laptop | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>Size measured in gigabytes (GB)<br/>in a present day laptop | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |
| <br/>Size measured in terabytes (TB)<br/>in a present day laptop | Cache | HDD | RAM | Registers | SSD |

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Cache replacement

* Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 
```
3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4
```

* Q2: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when an **optimal** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

<p style="height:6em;"></p>

* Q3: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **first in first out (FIFO)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

<p style="height:6em;"></p>

* Q4: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

<p style="height:6em;"></p>

## Extra practice

* Q5: _What output is produced by this program, assuming the starting process's PID is 7034 and PIDs are sequentially assigned to new processes._


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Begin\n");
    int result = fork();
    if (result == 0) {
        printf("A %d %d\n", result, getpid());
    } else if (result > 0) {
        wait(NULL);
        printf("B %d %d\n", result, getpid());
    }
    int result2 = fork();
    if (result2 == 0) {
        printf("C %d %d\n", result2, getpid());
    } else if (result > 0) {
        wait(NULL);
        printf("D %d %d\n", result2, getpid());
    }
}
```
