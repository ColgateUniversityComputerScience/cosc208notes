    * Complete "Getting to know you" questionnaire
    * Review the syllabus
    * Read Dive Into Systems 0.0, 1.0-1.2.1, 1.3 and answer pre-class questions
* First lab next week

## Outline
* Getting to know each other
* Intro to computer systems
* Syllabus highlights

## Getting to know me
* My name is...Noah Apthorpe
* Please call me...Professor (or Dr.) Apthorpe
* My personal pronouns are...he/him
* Something I did over the summer that I enjoyed is...whitewater rafting in central California.
* Something about computer science I really enjoy is...thinking about how programmed systems interact with people and policies.
* Something I want you to know about my life at Colgate is...If my office door is open, please say hi! I may not have time to answer questions about coursework outside of scheduled office hours, but I'm happy to schedule a 1:1 meetings -- please don't hesitate to ask.

## What is a computer system?
* _What do you think of when you hear the term "computer systems"?_

## Main components of a computer system
* Central processing unit (CPU) — executes assembly instructions
* Random access memory (RAM) — stores program data (code, variables, etc.) at runtime
* Secondary storage devices (e.g., hard disk drive, solid state drive stores) – program data (code, documents, etc.) persistently
* Input/output (I/O) ports – receives user input (e.g., keyboard, mouse, audio); provides output to users (e.g., text, graphics, audio)
* Operating system (OS) — manages hardware resources

## Why is it important to learn about computer systems?
* To effectively debug errors related to data representation and memory
* To write more efficient programs
* To leverage parallelism
* To learn how the world works!

## Course topics
* C
* Number representation
* Program memory
* Architecture
* Assembly
* Multiprocessing
* Efficiency
* Virtualization

## Syllabus highlights
* Important dates: midterm exams evenings of Sept 27 and Oct 30
* Before each class, read listed textbook sections and answer pre-class questions on Moodle
    * Use the pre-class questions to guide your reading
    * For Monday: Read Dive Into Systems 0.0, 1.0-1.2.1, 1.3 and answer pre-class questions
* Time management: start projects when they are released and work over multiple shorter sessions
* Deadlines: I will be reasonably flexible as long as you are responsible

* Academic integrity: 
    * Do not share or copy code from other students
    * Indicate if code is copied from an external source
    * I want you to succeed, and I will do everything I can to help you
* Standards-based grading:
    * 17 standards
    * 4 levels of mastery: (A) advanced, (B) meets expectations, (C) partial mastery, (D) little or no mastery
    * Pre-class questions and in-class activities facilitate learning
    * Progamming projects and exams (two midterms and a final) assess your mastery
