# Efficiency: caching (continued); loop optimization
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-04-10_

## Announcements
* DEI assignment 3 due Thursday @ 11pm
* Project 4 due Thursday, April 20

## Warm-up

Q1: _For each of the following scenarios, indicate whether it is an example of temporal locality, spatial locality, or neither._

* Gates for flights on the same airline are located in the same airport terminal/concourse
* A grocery list is arranged in alphabetical order
* Clothes in a closet are grouped into outfits, with a shirt and a pair of pants stored next to each other
* Boxes of cereal, bowls, and spoons are stored in adjacent kitchen cabinets/drawers
* You repeatedly check your phone for new messages
* A variable used in a for loop
* Variables used in different functions
* A function's parameters, which are each used once within the function

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time take a few deep breaths to reduce stress.

## Cache replacement

* Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 
```
3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4
```
* Q2: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when an **optimal** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

* Q3: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **first in first out (FIFO)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

<p style="height:8em;"></p>

* Q4: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above question; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Optimizing loops for locality

* Q5: _Modify the following function to improve spatial locality_


```c
void hundreds() {
    int *nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * 1000);
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j+= 100) {
            nums[i+j] = i;
        }
    }
}
```

<p style="height:9em;"></p>

* Q6: _Modify the following function to improve temporal locality_


```c
int odds(int *nums, int length) {
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        nums[i] = nums[i] % 2;
    }
    int count = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
        count += nums[j];
    }
    return count;
}
```

<p style="height:10em;"></p>

* Q7: _Modify the following function to improve spatial locality_


```c
void multiplication(int grid[][], int rows, int cols) {
    for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            grid[r][c] = c * r;
        }
    }
}
```

* Q8: _Modify the following function to improve temporal locality_


```c
long stdev(int *nums, int length) {
    long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
    }
    int mean = sum / length;
    sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < length; j++) {
        int diff = nums[j] - mean;
        sum += diff * diff:
    }
    mean = sum / length;
    return sqrt(mean);
}
```

## Extra practice

Q9: _For each of the following instances of caching, indicate whether the caching is motivated by temporal or spatial locality._

* A CPU caches the first 32 instructions of a function when the function is called
* A CPU caches all of the instructions for a frequently called function
* A web browser caches the Moodle pages for your courses, which you view multiple times per week
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches a video that has gone viral
* A content distribution network (CDN) caches "recommended videos" related to a video
