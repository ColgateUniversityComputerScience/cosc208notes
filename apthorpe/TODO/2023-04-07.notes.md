## Temporal vs. spatial locality

* _What is temporal locality?_
    * Access the same data repeatedly
    * E.g., for loop variable
* _What is spatial locality?_
    * Access data with a similar scope
    * E.g., next item in array
    * E.g., local variables/parameters, which are stored in the same stack frame
* Analogies for temporal and spatial locality
    * Book storage (Dive Into Systems Section 11.3.2)
        * Temporal locality — store most frequently used books at your desk, less frequently used books on your bookshelf, and least frequently used books at the library
        * Spatial locality — checkout books on the same/nearby subjects when you go to the library
    * Groceries (pre-class questions 3 & 4)
        * Temporal locality — you store food you eat frequently in the front of the refrigerator, while you store food you eat infrequently in the back of the refrigerator
        * Spatial locality — you organize the items on your grocery list based on the aisle in which they are located
    * _With a partner, develop your own analogy for temporal and spatial locality_

## CPU caches

* _Why do we have caches on the CPU?_ — accessing main memory is ~100x slower than accessing a register
* Store instructions and data (stack, heap, etc.) from main memory
* Three levels — L1, L2, and L3
* Range in size from a few KB to a few MB – L1 is smallest and fastest; L3 is largest and slowest
* Cache line (i.e., cache entry) is typically larger than a word — e.g., 128 bytes
    * _Why?_ — spatial locality
* What happens when we write to memory?
    * Write through cache — write to the cache and main memory
    * Write back cache — initially write to the cache; write to main memory when the entry is evicted from the cache
    * What are the advantages of each approach?
        * Write through cache ensures consistency between CPU cores
        * Write back cache only incurs the overhead of accessing main memory when absolutely necessary

## Cache replacement

* Assume a cache can hold 3 entries and the following 15 data accesses occur: 
```
3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4
```
* Q2: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when an **optimal** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

_Postponed to next class_

* Q3: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **first in first out (FIFO)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

_Postponed to next class_

* Q4: _What is the sequence of hits, insertions, and replacements that occur when a **least recently used (LRU)** cache replacement algorithm is used?_

_Postponed to next class_

## Extra practice

* Q5: _Cross-out unnecessary loads and stores in the following assembly code._
