## Announcements
* Project 3 due Thursday, Nov 9

## Outline
* System calls continued
* Process abstraction
* Creating processes (`fork`)

## System calls

* https://thevivekpandey.github.io/posts/2017-09-25-linux-system-calls.html

## Process abstraction

* Process — running program and its corresponding machine state (code, memory, and register values)
    * Program is static code and static data; process is dynamic instance of code and data
    * Cooking analogy
        * Recipe == program
        * Following a recipe == process
        * Ingredients == program inputs
        * Prepared food == program outputs
        * Cabinets, fridge, etc. == persistent storage
        * Prep area (e.g., counter) == registers & main memory
        * Contents and status of the prep area; current step of recipe == machine state
        * Chef == CPU
    * Can have multiple processes all running different instances of the same program
        * Cooking analogy — chef may be making multiple batches of the same recipe
* OS is responsible for...
    * Creating processes — when a user or another application requests it
    * Scheduling processes — i.e., deciding when/which process should be allowed to use the CPU
    * Switching processes — i.e., saving the machine state of one process and restoring the machine state of another process; called context switching
    * Cleaning-up processes — i.e., releasing any resources they are using when the process is done
    * Interacting with I/O devices (e.g., disks, NICs, graphics card) on behalf of processes

* Q1: _Consider building a Lego kit as an analogy for operating systems' process abstraction. Match each component of the analogy with the corresponding component of a real computer system._

* Instruction booklet == program
* Following the assembly instructions == process
* Lego bricks == program inputs
* Completed kit == program outputs
* Cabinet/drawers for storing Legos == persistent storage
* Building area (e.g., tabletop) == registers and main memory
* Current step for the instruction booklet == program counter
* You == CPU

## Creating processes

* `int fork()`
    * Creates an exact copy of the running process, except for the return value from `fork` — return `0` to child (i.e., new) process; return child’s process ID to parent process (i.e., process that called fork)
    * Both child and parent resume execution from place where `fork` was called

* Q2: _What does the following code output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Before fork\n");
    fork();
    printf("After fork\n");
    return 0;
}
```

    Before fork
    After fork
    After fork


* Q3: _What does the following code output (assuming the new process has PID 1819)?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>    
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Before fork\n");
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child gets %d\n", pid);
    } else {
        printf("Parent gets %d\n", pid);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```
Before fork
Child gets 0
Parent gets 1819
```
OR
```
Before fork
Parent gets 1819
Child gets 0
``` 

## Extra practice

* Q6: _What does the following code output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int value = 100;
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        value -= 50;
    } else {
        value += 50;
    }
    printf("My value is %d\n", value);
    return 0;
}
```

```
My value is 50
My value is 150
```
OR
```
My value is 150
My value is 50
```

* Q7: _What does the following code output?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Begin\n");
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child\n");
        return 0;
    } else {
        printf("Parent\n");
    }
    printf("End\n");
}
```

```
Begin
Child
Parent
End 
```
OR
```
Begin
Parent
Child
End 
```
OR
```
Begin
Parent
End 
Child
```

* Q8: _How would you modify the above program such that `Child` always prints before `Parent`?_


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Begin\n");
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child\n");
        return 0;
    } else {
        wait(NULL);
        printf("Parent\n");
    }
    printf("End\n");
}
```

    Begin
    Child
    Parent
    End
