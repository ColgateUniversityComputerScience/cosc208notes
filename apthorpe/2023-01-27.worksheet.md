# C: control structures; functions
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-01-27_

## Announcements
* Before next class: read _Dive Into Systems_ 1.4.1, 2.9.5 and answer pre-class questions
* DEI assignment 1 due Thurs, Feb 9 @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Control structures
* Defining functions

## Warm-up
* Q1: _Write a program that prints the number of days, hours, and minutes in a week._

<div style="height:10em;"></div>

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the warm-up; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Control structures


* Q2: _Write a program that flips a coin: call `random()` to generate a random number, and print `heads` if the number is even and `tails` if the number is odd._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q3: _Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q4: _Write the same program using a while loop._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Defining functions

* C compiler must know a functionâ€™s return type and the number and type of its parameters before it encounters any calls to that function


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int result = add(1,2);
    printf("%d\n", result);
}
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x+y;
}
```

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/tmpi2tm2ej0.c:3:18: error: implicit declaration of function 'add' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
        int result = add(1,2); // Compiler doesn't know if this call is valid 
                     ^
    1 error generated.
    [C kernel] GCC exited with code 1, the executable will not be executed

* Q5: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

* Q6: _Write a function called `flipcase` that takes a letter and returns the letter in the opposite case. If the character is not a letter, then return the character unchanged._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

## Extra practice
* Q7: _Write a program that prints out the powers of 2 from 2 through 2048._

* Q8: _Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20, except:_
    * _If the number is divisible by 3 then print `Three`_
    * _If the number is divisible by 5 then print `Five`_
    * _If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print `Both`_

* Q9: _Write a program that prints every letter of the alphabet in upper and lower case: `AaBbCcDd...YyZz`_

* Q10: _Write a function called `floorm` that takes two integers and rounds down the first integer to the closest multiple of the second integer._
