# C: Functions, libraries, stack frames
_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2023-08-30_

## Warm-up

* Q1: _Write a function called `isletter` that takes a character and returns `1` if the character is a letter, or `0` otherwise._

<div style="height:20em;"></div>

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the warm-up; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.


## Defining functions

* Q2: In the biological process of cell division, each cell divides into two cells and the process repeats. _Write a function called `cells` that takes the number of rounds of cell division that occur and computes the total number of cells that will exist after the specified number of rounds (assuming you started with a single cell)._

<div style="height:20em;"></div>

* Q3: _Write a function called `rounds` that takes the number of cells that should exist and computes the number of rounds of cell division that must occur to have at least that many cells (assuming you started with a single cell)._

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

## Program stack

* Q4: _Track the state of the stack for this program_
    * Remember that C is **pass-by-value** â†’ changes made to a variable inside a function will not be preserved outside of the function


```python
#include <stdio.h>

int multiply(int z) {
    return z * 5 / 9;
}

int subtract(int x, int y) {
    return x - y;
}

int convert(int t) {
    int u = subtract(t, 32);
    int v = multiply(u);
    return v;
}

int main() {
    int f = 68;
    int c = convert(68);
    printf("%dF is %dC\n", f, c); 
}
```

<div style="height:25em;"></div>

* Q5: _What is the output of this program?_


```python
#include <stdio.h>

int copy(int a, int b) {
    a = b;
    return a;
}

int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 7;
    int z = copy(x, y);
    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, z);
}
```


## Extra practice

* Q6: _Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20, except:_
    * _If the number is divisible by 3 then print `Three`_
    * _If the number is divisible by 5 then print `Five`_
    * _If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print `Both`_

* Q7: _Write a program that prints every letter of the alphabet in upper and lower case: `AaBbCcDd...YyZz`_

* Q8: _Write a function called `floorm` that takes two integers and rounds down the first integer to the closest multiple of the second integer._

* Q9: _Write a function called `print_x` that takes an integer n that prints the letter `X` n lines high and n characters wide. You can assume n is an odd number. For example, if n = 9, the program's output would be:_
    ```
    \       /
     \     /
      \   /
       \ /
        X
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    /       \
    ```

* Q10: _Draw the contents of the stack immediately before the program prints "1 x 2"_. Use [C tutor](https://pythontutor.com/c.html) to visualize the execution of this program and check your drawing


```python
#include <stdio.h>

int squared(int base) {
    return base * base;
}

int dbl(int num) {
    printf("%d x 2\n", num);
    return num * 2;   
}

int two(int exponent) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
        result = dbl(result);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    int s = squared(3);
    printf("%d^2 is %d\n", n, s);
    int t = two(3);
    printf("2^%d is %d\n", n, t);
}
```

* Q11: _Write a function called `flipcase` that takes a letter and returns the letter in the opposite case. If the character is not a letter, then return the character unchanged._
