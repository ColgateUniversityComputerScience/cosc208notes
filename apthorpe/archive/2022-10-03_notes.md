_COSC 208, Introduction to Computer Systems, 2022-10-03_

## Announcements
* Programming project 2 due Thurs @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* von Neumann Architecture
* Hardware building blocks
* Logic gates

## Warm-up
* Assume you are given the following code:
    ```C
    struct account {
        int number; // Account number
        int balance; // Current account balance
    };
    int deposit(struct account *acct, int amount);
    int transfer(struct account *from, struct amount *to, int amount);
    struct account *open_account(int starting);
    int close_account(struct account *acct);
    ```
* Q1: _Write the `deposit` function, which adds `amount` to the balance of `acct`. The function should return the amount deposited._
    ```C
    int deposit(struct account *acct, int amount) {
        acct->balance += amount;
        return amount;
    } 
    ```
* Q2: _Write the `transfer` function which moves `amount` from one account to another. The function should return the amount transferred if the transfer was successful or 0 otherwise._
    ```C
    int transfer(struct account *from, struct amount *to, int amount) {
        if (from->balance < amount)
            return 0;
        from->balance -= amount;
        to->balance += amount;
        return amount;
    }
     ```
* Q3: _Write the `open_account` function, which creates a new account with a random account number and the specified `starting` balance._
    ```C
    struct account *open_account(int starting) {
        struct account *new = malloc(sizeof(struct account));
        new->number = rand();
        new->balance = starting;
        return new;
    }
    ```
* Q4: _Write the `close_account` function, which eliminates the account `acct` and returns the remaining balance._
    ```C
    int close_account(struct account *acct) {
        int remain = acct->balance;
        free(acct);
        return remain;
    }
    ```

## von Neumann Architecture

* _Where are instructions stored prior to execution?_ — memory unit
* _Where are instructions stored during execution?_ — instruction register
* _Where is data stored when it is not in use?_ — memory unit
* _Where is data stored when it is being operated on?_ — (general purpose) registers
* Notice: instructions and data are both stored in the memory unit, but there are different registers for instructions and data in the CPU
* Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store cycle
    * _What happens in the fetch stage?_ — The control unit loads the next instruction from memory, based on the program counter, into the instruction register
    * _What happens in the decode stage?_ — break instruction into operation and operands; load operands from memory into registers, if necessary
    * _What happens in the execute stage?_ — The ALU performs the operation on the operands
    * _What happens in the store stage?_ — The control unit stores the result in memory
* _How can we make this cycle faster?_
    * Pipelining
    * Parallelism
    * Faster bus
    * Faster ALU/control unit
    * Faster memory
    * Use separate memory units for storing instructions and data and separate buses for loading/storing instructions and data; known as the Harvard Architecture, which addresses the von Neumann bottleneck

## Logic gates
