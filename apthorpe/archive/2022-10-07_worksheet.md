## N-bit circuits
Q3: _Fill-in the truth-table for `A > B` when A and B are two bits_

| A1 A2 | B1 B2 | A > B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   0 | 0   0 |       |
| 0   1 | 0   0 |       |
| 1   0 | 0   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 0   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 0   1 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   0 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   0 |       |
| 0   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 0   1 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   0 | 1   1 |       |
| 1   1 | 1   1 |       |

## Arithmetic circuits
Q2: _Your goal is to create a 1-bit circuit to perform addition. The circuit will take 3 input bits (`A`, `B`, and `carry_in`) and produce 2 output bits (`sum` and `carry_out`)._

Q2a: _Truth table for this operation_

| `A` | `B` | `carry_in` | `sum` | `carry_out` |
|-----|-----|------------|-------|-------------|
|  0  |  0  |     0      |   0   |      0      |
|  0  |  0  |     1      |   1   |      0      |
|  0  |  1  |     0      |   1   |      0      |
|  0  |  1  |     1      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  0  |     0      |   1   |      0      |
|  1  |  0  |     1      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  1  |     0      |   0   |      1      |
|  1  |  1  |     1      |   1   |      1      |

Q2b: _What is the boolean expression for `sum`?_
```







```

Q2c: _Draw the circuit for `sum`_

Q2d: _What is the boolean expression for `carry_out`?_
