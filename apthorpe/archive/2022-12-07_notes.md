## Warm-up
* Q1: _Draw a diagram of a system that does **not** use a hypervisor._
* Q2: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 1 hypervisor**._
* Q3: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 2 hypervisor**._

## CPU sharing
* Use same approach OS uses for sharing CPU between processes — Limited Direct Execution (LDE)
* _Recall: How does LDE work in OS?_
    * Put CPU in user mode
    * Give process exclusive access to CPU
    * Process issues a syscall to perform privileged operation
    * Timer interrupt allows OS to regain control
* To use LDE with a VM
    * Put CPU in user mode
    * Give VM exclusive access to CPU
    * Process issues a syscall -OR- OS attempts to perform privileged operation
    * Timer interrupt allows hypervisor to regain control
* Recall: _How does a process make a syscall?_ — load syscall number into register `x8` and execute `svc` instruction
* _What happens when a process makes a syscall?_
    1. CPU saves registers to the OS stack
    2. CPU switches to kernel mode
    3. CPU uses system call number to index into OS's table of syscall handlers 
    4. Branch and link to syscall handler code
    5. Restore registers from the OS stack
    6. Switch CPU to user mode
    7. Resume execution after `svc` 
* Syscalls with a type 1 hypervisor
    * Processes in virtualized OS do the same as before
    * Hypervisor’s syscall handler is invoked by hardware instead of OS’s syscall handler
    * Actually want to invoke OS's syscall handler — the hypervisor does this
    * Hypervisor knows where OS trap table is located, because populating syscall table is a privileged instruction, so hypervisor interposed on these operations when OS booted
* Steps when process in virtualized OS makes a syscall
    1. CPU saves registers to the hypervisor stack
    2. CPU switches to kernel mode
    3. CPU uses system call number to index into VM's table of syscall handlers 
    4. **Switch CPU from kernel to user mode**
    5. Branch and link to syscall handler code
    6. **Switch CPU from user to kernel mode**
    7. Restore registers from the hypervisor stack
    8. Switch CPU to user mode
    9. Resume execution after `svc`
* Extra work to always trap to hypervisor, which then invokes OS code
* Possible solutions
    * Hardware support — e.g., supervisor mode that is between user and kernel mode
    * Para-virtualization — modify the OS so it's aware there is a hypervisor and the two can interact directly
    * Containers — use a single OS, but create groups of processes that are isolated from other processes
        * OS's process abstraction already isolates each process's CPU time, memory, and registers, but processes can still use syscalls to pass messages to each other, wait for each other, access a common set of files, etc.

## Containers
* Containers — use a single OS, but create groups of processes that are isolated from other processes
    * OS's process abstraction already isolates each process's CPU time, memory, and registers, but processes can still use syscalls to pass messages to each other, wait for each other, access a common set of files, etc.
* Containers share the kernel — i.e., core OS functionality like syscalls, scheduler, I/O interface
    * VMs do **not** share the kernel
* Containers and VMs do **not** share the file system ==> containers and virtual machines do **not** share libraries, executables, etc.
* Containers and VMs do **not** share user accounts
* Containers and VMs do **not** share network stacks ==> e.g., each container or VM has its own Internet Protocol (IP) address
* Compute and storage resources (e.g., CPU, memory) available to containers and VMs can be limited
* Containers and VMS share the hardware

## Data centers
* _What is a data center?_ — a large collection of computer systems housed in a single physical location
* Primary components
    * Servers — with multi-core CPU, main memory, secondary storage, and network interface card (NIC)
    * Racks — cabinet containing tens of servers
    * Rows — line of racks
    * Network — routers, switches, and fiber optic cables connecting servers/racks together to allow them to exchange data
        * Includes connectivity to other data centers and the Internet
    * Power system — electrical wires, distribution units, generators, connections to the power grid
    * Cooling system — fans, cooling units (mechanical, evaporative, outdoor air, etc.)
* Resources can be pooled together to provide more computing and storage than a single server
    * Application can be replicated on many servers (running many processes) to handle a large volume of data/users and provide fault-tolerance
    * Main memory on many servers can be pooled together to provide the abstraction of large, low-latency storage
    * Files can be distributed/replicated across secondary storage on many servers to handle a large volume of data and provide fault-tolerance
