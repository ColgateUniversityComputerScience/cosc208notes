## Warm-up

* Q1: _Draw a diagram of a system that does **not** use a hypervisor or containers._

* Q2: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 1 hypervisor**._

* Q3: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **type 2 hypervisor**._

* Q4: _Draw a diagram of a system that uses a **container**._

## Data centers

* _What is a data center?_ — a large collection of computer systems housed in a single physical location
* Primary components
    * Servers — with multi-core CPU, main memory, secondary storage, and network interface card (NIC)
    * Racks — cabinet containing tens of servers
    * Rows — line of racks
    * Network — routers, switches, and fiber optic cables connecting servers/racks together to allow them to exchange data
        * Includes connectivity to other data centers and the Internet
    * Power system — electrical wires, distribution units, generators, connections to the power grid
    * Cooling system — fans, cooling units (mechanical, evaporative, outdoor air, etc.)
* Resources can be pooled together to provide more computing and storage than a single server
    * Application can be replicated on many servers (running many processes) to handle a large volume of data/users and provide fault-tolerance
    * Main memory on many servers can be pooled together to provide the abstraction of large, low-latency storage
    * Files can be distributed/replicated across secondary storage on many servers to handle a large volume of data and provide fault-tolerance
